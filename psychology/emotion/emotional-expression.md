### Nonverbal Expression of Emotion
- Types of gestures (Ekman, 2001)
	- Illustrators: highlight or accentuate speech
	- Manipulators: one body part contacts another
	- Emblems: Convey conventional meanings

### Personal Space
- Hall (1966): personal distance correlates with emotional distance
	- Exception: intimidation (Brodsky, 1999)

- Four Implicit "rules" to personal space
	1. Public (12 ft)
	2. Social (4-12 ft)
	3. Personal (1.5-4 ft)
	4. Intimate (0-1.5 ft)

### Lying and Lie Detection
- Nonverbal cues are not more reliable indicators of lying than verbal cues (Vrij et al, 2019)
- Over-reliance on nonverbal cues leads to poor detection accuracy 
	- Poor = "no better chance" (~54%) (Bond & DePaulo, 2006)
	- Includes customs officials, psychiatrists, police officers, and polygraph

### Lie Detection: Polygraph Testing
- Predicated on existence of physiological indicators of lying ( Lykken, 1998)

	1. Controlled Question Test (CQT)
		- Control... Reflect probably lies
			- Used to extract "baseline" readings
		- Irrelevant... unrelated to crime in question
			- “Are physiological responses stronger to relevant vs. irrelevant/control Qs?”
		- Relevant... Directly related to crime in question

	2. Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT)
		- Physiological response to "concealed knowledge" about crime (Ben-Shakhar, 2011)
		- Multiple choice-style questions
		- Fewer-false positives but more false-negatives (lacono & patrick, 2006)

- Issues with CQT
	- High rate of false positives (Rosky, 2013)
	- Biased against innocent suspects
	- Confuses physiological arousal with deception
	- Nontrivial number of false negatives... Use of countermeasures (Ben-Shakhar, 2011)

### Alternative Lie Detection Methods
- Brain scans (EEG, fMRI)
	- Not well supported (La Tona 2020, Meijer & Verschuere 2017)
- Truth serum....
	- Barbiturates... Relaxation and sleepiness 
		- Lowers threshold for reporting memories... both true and false (Lynn, 2003)
- Integrity Tests
	- Assess tendency to steal or cheat
	- Utility is mixed, high rate of false-positives (Van Iddekinge, 2012)
