### what is transaction volume?
- transaction volume represents the number of transactions being processed on the [[blockchain]] within a certain period
- it can also refer to the total value of these transactions

### why does transaction volume matter?
- *network usage* - a higher transaction volume indicates that more people are using the [[blockchain]] which suggests its growing utility and adoption

- *network stress* - very high transaction volumes can sometimes lead to congestion, meaning transactions might take longer to confirm or become more expensive
