> the [[user-experience]] requires use of visual and programming technologies

### How to build the UX?
- *research* - understanding product and market
- *prototype* - using visual technology to help wireframe idea
- *build* - build with software and programming technologies

### Technology used to research a product and market
- UX designers have a plethora of tools they can use for conducting research on a market. Most of these consist of data analysis and document editing tools.
### Technology used to visually prototype a UX
- UX designers should get comfortable with tools like figma to wireframe their product prototypes.

### Technology used to build a UX
- UX designers and developers should understand a couple programming languages:

**FRONT-END:**
- html - used to create basic website structure and content like headings, paragraphs, quotes, and images (like the skeleton of a website)

- css - used in conjunction with html to control colors, font size, and other visual aspects of a website (how the html is displayed)

- javascript - used to make web pages dynamic... this includes animating images, automating functions, and enabling interactive components. 

- [[python]] - used for implementing [[user-interface]](s), content management systems, data analysis, and more.

**BACK-END**
- [[python]] - used to manage databases, process web requests, and to build server side logic for web applications. (and building the universal backend)

- java - similar to python, used to build server-side applications, handling database operations, processing HTTP requests, and managing application security.

- php - similar to python and java, but can also handle HTTP requests and generates html content that is sent to the clients browser.

**MOBILE**
- objective-c - the primary language used for native software on Apple products.

- swift - more modern and concise version of objective c (the python of mobile development for Apple products)
