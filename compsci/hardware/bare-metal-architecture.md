what is the structure of a computer and how do all the components interact?

### COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE DIAGRAM

![[hardware-architecture.excalidraw]]

1. **CPU** - is the part of the computer that is built to be obsessed with "what's next?" If your computer is rated at 3.0 Gigahertz, it means that the CPU will ask "What next?" 3 billion times per second. 

2. **Main Memory** - is used to store information that the CPU needs in a hurry. The main memory is nearly as fast as the CPU, ***BUT*** the *information stored in the main memory vanishes when the computer is turned off.* 

3. **The Secondary Memory** - is also used to store information, but is much slower than the main memory. *The advantage of the secondary memory is that it can store information even when there is no power to the computer*. Examples of secondary memory are disk drives or flash memory (disk/flash drives)

4. **I/O Devices** - our screen, mouse, microphone, speaker, touchpad, etc. They are all ways humans interface with computers. These gave birth to the pursuits of:
	- [[user-interface]] - the point at which humans make contact with computers
	- [[user-experience]] - how a user interacts with technology

5. **Network** - a very slow place to store and retrieve data that might not always be "up". So in a sense, the network is a slower and at times unreliable form of secondary memory.

### How does this relate to programming?
- Programmers write [[computer-programs]] to tell the CPU to use the main memory, secondary memory, network, or the input/output devices.
	- programs can be written in different languages like [[python]] and [[java]]
	- programs hold the instructions that answer the CPU's **"What's next?"** question
