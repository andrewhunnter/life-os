### what are network fees?
- network fees are charges that users pay to have their transactions processed by the network
- in systems like [[bitcoin]], miners earn these fees as part of their reward, validating transactions and adding new blocks to the blockchain

### why it matters?
- *demand indicator* - when the network is busy, users are often willing to pay higher fees to get their transactions processed quickly. So, rising fees can indicate that the network is in high demand

- *congestion signal* - high fees may also signal that the network is congested (similar to increasing [[transaction-volume]], which might prompt users or developers to look for solutions to increase capacity or efficiency)

- *economic incentive* - fees are also an important part of the ecosystem, incentivizing miners to secure the network and process transactions even when lock rewards are lower
