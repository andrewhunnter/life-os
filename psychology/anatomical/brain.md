### why does the brain matter?
- is the main organ when dealing with [[psychology]]

### Different ways to "measure" the brain

1. *brain structure*

	- **CT** - 3D reconstruction of multiple x-rays
	- **MRI** - measures release of energy from water in tissues

2. *brain activity*

	- **EEG** - uses electrodes placed on scalp surface. measures averaged neural activity at various time points (useful for when, not where)
		- 2022 Parkland trial (EEG/qEEG was used)

	- **PET** - follow path's brain or gasoline (glucose), radioactive but short lived. (not ideal for most research)

	- **fMRI** - follows oxygenated blood flow. Increase activity is increased demand for oxygenated blood. It helps visualize brain activity during specific tasks. Discovery of default *mode network*, found a lot of brain activity even at rest.

	- **MEG** - measures tiny magnetic fields to detect electrical activity. Tracks changes over extremely brief time intervals

### A caution about localization of brain function
- most brain regions work in "in concert" (*a lot of moving parts*)
- Single psychological function orchestrated by multiple brain areas (like speech)
- Single brain area has multiple functions
- We cannot make casual claims about localization using functional imaging

### Internal and External brain manipulation

- Deep Brain Stimulation (**DBS**) - ***INTERNAL***
	- Implantation of battery-powered electrodes
	- Parkinsons, OCD, depression, epilepsy, dementia

- Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (**TMS**) - ***EXTERNAL***
	- Application of magnetic field to skull surface
	- enhances or interrupts brain function
	- the only non-invasive technique that allows for casual inferences

### Applied Use of Brain Scans: Psychology and the Law

- Increasing popularity of functional brain images as potential exculpatory evidence
- Reduced culpability if brain dysfunction can be linked to violence
- Daubert hearing - determines admissibility
