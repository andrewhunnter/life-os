### Defining motivation...
- Drive that propels us in specific direction
	- Needs
	- Wants

### Theories of motivation: Drive Reduction Theory
- Drives motivate us to minimize negative feelings and seek pleasure (Dollard & Miller, 1950)
- Drives are unpleasant
	- Satisfying drives reduces tension... pleasure
- Strength of drives serves evolutionary function (thirst vs. hunger)
- Goal: maintain homeostasis
- Strength of drive and task performance are affected by physiological arousal level
- Yerkes-Dodson Law (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908)
	- Existence of an optimal "peak" of arousal for best performance
- Drives sometimes clash with each other
	- Party introductions (approach vs. avoid)
	- Selecting a Netflix series (approach vs. approach)
	- Cleaning the house (avoid vs. avoid)
- Avoidance gradient is steeper than approach gradient (Bogdartz, 1965)

### Theories of Motivation: Incentive Theories
- We are motivated by positive goals to act
	- Intrinsic (internal) vs. extrinsic (external) motivation
	- Lepper 1973... Liking the activity  vs. liking the reward
- Contrast effect (Crepsi, 1942)
	- sudden withdrawal of anticipated reinforcement = reduced likelihood of action

### Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs...
- Abraham Maslow (1954, 1971)
- Must satisfy primary needs before secondary needs
	- Primary - basic physiological/biological needs
	- Secondary - psychological desires

### Motivation in daily life: Hunger & Eating
- Hunger = complex interplay of brain and digestive organs
	- Hypothalamus (hormone release)
	- Ghrelin -> Hunger
	- Cholecystokinin (CCK) -> Fullness
- Role of glucose (glucostatic theory)
	- Drops in glucose initiate hunger
- Obesity 41.9% of American Adults (NHANES, 2021)
	- Biological contributors:
		- Resistance to leptin (Hamann & Matthaei, 1996)
		- Serotonin sensitivity (Lowe & Levine, 2005)
		- Biological set-pointt (rosovsky & Powley, 1977)
		- Mutation of melanocortin-4 gene (Yeo et al., 2021)
	- Psychological contributors:
		- Distraction from negative emotions (Stice et al., 2005)
		- “Portion distortion” (Wansink, 2009)
		- Oversensitivity to external cues (Hussain et al., 2021; Schacter, 1968

### Motivation in Daily Life: Eating Disorders
- Generally hallmarked by:
	- Preoccupation with food
	- Motivation to stay thin or lose weight
	- Guilt or other negative emotions associated with eating
	- Distorted perception of appearance
- Genetic and sociocultural contributors (Derenne & Beresin 2018, HImmerich 2019)
- Bulimia nervosa
	- consuming high amounts of calories while avoiding weight gain
		- binge-purge pattern
			- no purge = binge eating disorder
			- no binge = purging disorder
	- relieves guilt, fear, and sadness
	- risk of esophageal tearing, erosion of teeth enamel, menstrual irregularities (Olguin, 2016)
- Anorexia nervosa
	- Extremely low weight achieved through calorie restriction
	- May lose upwards of 25-50% of bodyweight
	- Risk of heart problems, electrolyte imbalance, osteoporosis, brain volume loss
		- 5-10% fatality rate (Frank, 2013)

### Motivation in daily life... Sexual Motivation
- Sexual desire: aka "libido"
- Biological influences
	- Testosterone
	- Serotonin
	- DRD4 gene (related to dopamine transmission)
- Males > females (Baumeister, 2001)
	- Sex drive is a continuum

### Motivation in daily life... Sexual Orientation
- Combination of genetic and environmental factors (Bailey, 2016)
- Genetic:
	- Association with thickness of corpus callosum (Witelson, 2008)
- Environmental:
	- fetal exposure to testosterone (Ellis & Ames, 1987)
	- Maternal immune responses (Blanchard 2018, Lippia 2021)
	- Cultural acknowledgement and acceptance
