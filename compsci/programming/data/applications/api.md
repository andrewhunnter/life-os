a set of rules that allows *different software applications* to **communicate** with each other

### Why do api(s) matter?
- They are a way for one program to request certain functionality or data from another program, without needing it to understand the internal details of how that program works.
- API can help reduce complexities within projects (ship faster)

### What is a api "use case"?
If you are building a weather app, you don't need to manually collect/update the data:
- you can use an **API** that allows your app to send a request for weather data for a particular city, and it will receive a response containing information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

> The API act as the interface that defines how your app can request weather data and how it will receive the response.
