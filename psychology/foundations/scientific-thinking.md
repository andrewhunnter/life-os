### what is scientific thinking?
- a series "tests" on a scientific claim
- a good practice when analyzing claims

### principles of scientific thinking

1. Ruling out Rival Hypotheses
- the named explanation is the **ONLY** claim for the observed result

2. Differentiating Correlation and Causation
- two things being associated with each other, without causing the other

3. Determining Falsifiability
- meaningful claims are capable of being disproved (can't predict everything)

4. Recognizing Replicability
- Failing to replicate a finding raises questions about its legitimacy

5.  Determining Generalizability
- "How well does the sample represent the population of interest"

6. Extraordinary evidence and claims
- Claims with more contradiction with preexisting knowledge (most of them are anecdotal, personal stories)

### why does scientific thinking matter?
- helps theories and findings field in the field [[psychology]] to be more empirical and quantitive. This is done to ensure the field maintains a solid framework for the future of the science. 

- This framework of thinking eliminates shitty claims, studies, and theories. Specifically claims are are considered [[pseudoscience]]
