### Considerations in Human Development

1. Clarifying Nature vs. Nurture
	- Gene-environment interaction
	- Genes -> environment... Impact of genes depends on environment

	- Nature via nurture (Lykken, 1995)
		- Genetic predispositions drive us to select or create certain environments that influence behavior

	- Gene expression
		- possessing certain genes doesn't guarantee they will be activated - depends on environmental triggers
			- Degree of expression can change from moment-to-moment (epi-genetics)

2. Mystique of Early Experience
	- Do we overestimate unique, long-term impact of early life experiences?
		- children are highly resilient (Bonanno, 2004)
		- Brain changes occur well into early adulthood (Brydges & Reddaway, 2020)

3. Attending to Cohort Effects
	- Systematic differences between generations can impact behavior
	- E.g. spending habits... Great depression vs. millennials
	- Risk in cross-sectional research (a "snapshot")
	- Can be avoided by using longitudinal design (a home movie)
	- Best option for observing differences behavior over the lifespan

4. Post-Hoc Fallacy
	- "Because A came before B, A must cause B"

5. Bidirectional Influences
	- Children's experiences influence development; development influences their experiences
