> the fundamental concept of programming

### What are algorithms?
- A **set of instructions** to perform some action or operation

### What is the **PURPOSE** of algorithms?
- Computers receive countless inputs from all different sources
	- All these inputs (data) need to be processed (mice, boards, sensors, or files)
		- Algorithms are curated instructions that determine how to PROCESS those inputs

### How do computers/programming **USE** algorithms?
- Computers use algorithms via [[computer-programs]]
	- an algorithm is written with *code* via *specific programming language*

### Visualizing Algorithms
