> encoding, storage, and retrieval of [[memories]]

### 3 processes of memory

1. **ENCODING**: getting information into memory banks (tulving and thompson, 1973)
	- critical dependence on attention
	- mnemonics can help us encode information in a way that makes recall easier
		- can be applied to almost anything
		- depend on having some store of knowledge to begin with

2. **STORAGE**: keeping information in memory
	- influenced by interpretations of and expectations for events
	- *schemas*: organized knowledge structure or mental model
		- provide frame or reference for interpreting new situations
		- can be characterized by a script (Schank & Abelson, 1977)
			- set order of events (seeing a movie)
		- prone to oversimplification
		- [[data-structure]]'s are often referred to as "schemas" 

3. **RETRIEVAL**: bringing information back from long-term memory stores to working memory
	- this is where we are most likely to notice memory issues
	- tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) states
	- largely cue-dependent
		- "hints" that facilitate recall
		- some association to conditions present during encoding

### Encoding Specificity (Tulving & Thompson, 1973)
- enhanced memory retrieval occurs in conditions that resemble encoding
	- context-dependent learning (physical location)
	- state-dependent learning (intoxicated vs. sober)
	- mood-dependent learning (happy vs. sad)
		- *not the same as mood congruence*!

### Measuring Memory: The 3 Rs
1. **Recall**: generating an answer on our own
	- open-ended questions
2. **Recognition**: selecting an answer from list of options
	- multiple-choice questions
3. **Relearning**: comparing speed of learning across study trials
