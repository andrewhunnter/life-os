### Stereotypes
- Broad application of belief about characteristics of group people
	- Can be positive, neutral, or negative
- Ultimate attribution error (Pettigrew, 1979)
	- attributing *negative* behavior of entire group to disposition
	- attributing *positive* behaviors of entire group to luck or rare exceptions
		- disregard for situational influences

### Prejudice
- Negative conclusion about a group not based on experience
- Tendency towards prejudice influenced by:
	- in-group bias
		- favoritism towards individuals inside our group (Van Bavel, 2008)
	- out-group homogeneity
		- tendency to view individuals outside our group as highly similar (Park & Rothbart, 1982)
			- easy to dismiss members of other groups

- implicit vs. explicit prejudice...
	- implicit association test (IAT)
- may arise from:
	- scapegoat hypothesis (J.W. Jackson, 1993)
	- Belief in a "just" world (Lerner, 1980)
	- Conformity to social norms
- Often (but not always) accompanies discrimination
	- negative behavior towards members of out-groups

### Combatting Prejudice
- superordinate goals
	- key: working together towards a higher purpose
	- Sherif et al, (1961): Robbers Cave Study 
	- Jigsaw classrooms
- Raise awareness through educational or workplace trainings
