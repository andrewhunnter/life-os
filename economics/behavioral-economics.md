### Key concepts of Behavioral Economics

- **Bounded Rationality:** making decisions based on limited information, cognitive constraints, and personal biases

- **Prospect Theory**: Individuals perceive losses and gains asymmetrically, feeling greater pain from a loss than satisfaction from an equivalent gain.

- **Anchoring:** people tend to rely on a reference point (the anchor) when assessing the value of an unknown option, which can lead to arbitrary or irrational decisions.

- **Mental Accounting**: Individuals mentally categorize and allocate expenses differently which can lead to biases like the sunk cost fallacy or the endowment effect.

- **Nudging**: Subtle changes to choice architecture can influence people's decisions without restricting their freedom of choice, through methods like default options, framing, or social proof.

Understanding these concept principles helps aid the [[user-experience]] because it enables designers and developers to create interfaces to help users make better choices.
