### what is GDP?
- is the market value of the final goods and services produced within a country in a give time period... there are 4 parts:

	1. **market value**
		- to measure total production, we must add together the productions with price

	2. **final goods and services**
		-  to calculate GDP... we value the final goods and services produced
		- *final good* - is an item that is bought by its final user during a specified time period
		- *intermediate good* - is an item that is produced by one firm, bought by another firm, and used as a component of a final good or service

	3. produced within a country
		- only goods and services produced within a country

	4. in a given time period
		- normally either a quarter of a year (can be annual too)

### how is GDP measured?
1.  total (aggregate) expenditure on goods and services
	- consumption expenditure + investment + government expenditure + net exports
2. total income earned producing goods and services

> GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
- general equation for measuring GDP on expenditure

> GDP = Wages + Rent + Interest + Profit
- general equation for measuring GDP on income
- at factor prices (add depreciation)
- at market values (add depreciation and taxes)

- both are equally precise, expenditure is the more popular model

### the circular flow model...
- the economy consists of house-holds, firms, governments, and the rest of the world... which trade in factor markets and goods/services markets

- ***households*** sell and firms buy the services of labor, capital, and land in factor markets... firms pay income to households, pay [[interest]] for use of capital and land.
	- firms' #retained-earnings are apart of household sector's income and is apart of economy's *aggregate income*

- firms sell and households buy consumer goods and services in goods markets
	- the total payment for these goods and services is **consumption expenditure**

- governments buy goods and services from firms aka government expenditure... does NOT include taxes

- firms in the United States sell goods/services to the rest of the world #exports and buy goods/services from the rest of the world or #imports
	- the value of exports minus imports is **net exports**

### understanding aggregate income
- ***aggregate income*** is the sum of all incomes earned by the factors of production in an economy 
	- wages & salaries - income earned by workers (households)
	- rents - income earned by property owners
	- [[interest]] - income from lending capital
	- profits - income earned by firms after expenses which can be distributed ass dividends or #retained-earnings
