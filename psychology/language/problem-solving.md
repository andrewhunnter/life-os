### Problem Solving
- generating a cognitive strategy to accomplish a goal
- approaches to problem solving:
	1. Following algorithms
	2. Breaking problem down into subproblems
	3. Drawing analogies
	4. Distributed cognition
- Often involves both *divergent* and *convergent* thinking
	- thinking "outside the box" vs. identifying the best solution

### Potential Obstacles in Problem Solving
- Salience of surface simialiriteis
	- undue attention to problem's superficial properties
	- overlooking underlying reasoning required for a solution
- mental sets
	- getting "boxed in" by past experiences
- functional fixedness
	- becoming "fixated" on conventional use for a particular object
