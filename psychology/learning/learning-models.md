> explanations for learning

### S-O-R Psychology
- "O" for organism (the learning)
	- organism must *interpret* stimulus before producing response (Mischel, 1979)
		- behavioral responses may differ by individual
		- "cognitive conditioning" (Grings, 1973)... 
			- either [[classical-conditioning]] or [[operant-conditioning]]
	- emphasizes role of *expectations in learning* (Rescorla. & Wagner, 1972)

### Latent Learning
- Learning can occur even when it's *not directly observable*
- Difference between competence (knowing) and performance (showing)... (Bradbard, 1986)
	- Reinforcement isn't necessary for learning to occur
	- Tolman and Honzik (1930)... Rat mazes
		- rats who received reinforcement were more "motivated" and rats who got cheese did the best in the trails vs the rats who never got cheese

### Observational Learning
- Learning by watching others ("models")
	- parents, teachers, authority figures
- Spares us requirement of firsthand learning
	- can be *adaptive*
- Can produce maladaptive habits
	- Bandura et al, (1961, 1963) or "Bobo Doll" experiments
- Role of mirror neurons (Rizzzolatti, 1996)

### Insight Learning
- the "aha!" moment - sudden understanding of a problem's solution
- Kohler (1925): Sultan the chimp
