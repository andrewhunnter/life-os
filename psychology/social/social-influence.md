	- Avoid rejection
	- Align with group norms

### The Asch Line Stuides (1955)
- 1 particpant and various confederates (actors)
- 12 trials in which line-match judgements were rendered verbally
- 75% of participants conformed to incorrect norm on at least 1 of 12 trials
- participant conformity was affected by:
	- uniformity of agreement
		- difference in the wrong answer
	- size of majority

### De-individuation
- tendency to engage in atypical behavior when stripped of unique individuality (Festinger, 1952)
	- Feeling of anonymity + lack of personal responsibility
- Online disinhibition (Suler, 2004)... Internet "trolling"
- Crowds can become more or less aggressive depending on prevailing social norms

### De-individuation: The Stanford Prison Experiment
- Sought to understand cause of dehumanizing prison conditions
- Random assignment to role: guard vs. prisoner
	- "Power" was arbitrary
- Abusive behavior started after Day 1

### Groupthink
- Emphasis on group consensus at expense of critical thinking and objectivity (Sunstein & Hastie, 2015)
	- lack of independence in group members' judgments
- 1986 challenger shuttle explosion
- can lead to cults in extreme forms
	- intense and unquestioning devotion to single person or cause
- best antidotes
	- encouraging dissent amongst group members
	- inoculation (mcguire 1964)

### Group Polarization
- Group discussion strengthens dominant position held by individual members (Myers & Lamm, 1976)
	- Polarization happens at individual level

### Obedience
- Adherence to instructions from those of higher authority
	- Influence is vertical (not horizontal)
- Social influence is explicit

### Milgram (1963)
- Experiment "evaluating the effects of punishment on  learning"
- Participant (teacher) and confederate (learner)
- Incorrect answer on task = command from experimenter to provide electric shock of increasing voltage
	- How high would participants go?
	- 66% of participants obeyed until the highest voltage level
