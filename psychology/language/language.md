### The Features of Language
- "Language" is fundamental by largely arbitrary
	- combines symbols (words and gestures) in rule-based ways to create meaning
	- goal achievement and social/emotions functions

### HOW and WHY did language develop?
- somewhat difficult to explain from an evolutionary perspective
- lengthly learning period and high brain power requirement
	- benefits > costs (Lieberman, 2007)
	- some commonalities
		- starting letter for "mom" and "dad" with similar letters among different languages (m+n and b+p+d for starters)
		- phonesthemes - "gl" of shine like glow or glitter

### Features of Language
1. Phonemes: categories of sound produced by vocal apparatus
	- ~100 distinct phonemes across all world languages
	- any given language uses only a subset
2. Morphemes: smallest unit of meaning (*semantic informatio*n)
	- combination of phonemes
	- words and prefixes, and suffixes

### The Features of Language
3. **SYNTAX**: grammatical rules that govern how words are organized 
	- word order, verb tenses, sentence structure
		- differs by language
	- idealized 

4. **EXTRALINGUISTIC INFORMATION**: non-verbal information
	- facial expression, body language, gestures, tone of voice, and conversation context

### Language Dialects
- Variations in the same language
	- people still able to understand each other

- Specific to geographic areas, social groups, or ethnic backgrounds
	- May differ in vocabulary, pronunciation, or syntax
	- regardless of differences of rules indicates an equally-valid syntax
