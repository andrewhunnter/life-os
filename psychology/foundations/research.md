### Why do we need research in psychology?
- to completely avoid this... naive realism + confirmation bias = self-fulfilling prophecy
- based on the fundamentals of [[scientific-thinking]]
- uses [[statistics]] or the "language of psychological research"

### Two forms of "research thinking"

1. **SYSTEM 1**: *Intuitive thinking*
	- quick and reflexive; your "gut feeling"
	- CAN BE useful in the right context

2. **SYSTEM 2**: *Analytical Thinking*
	- Slow and reflective
	- requires more effort
	- capable of overriding conclusions from intuitive thinking

### Scientific Methodology for psychology
- What should we look for in psychological research?
	- *RANDOM SELECTION* - generalizability
	- *RELIABILITY* = consistency
	- *VALIDITY* = accuracy
	- *REPLICABILITY* = openness and transparency 

### Different psychological studies

1. **Naturalistic Observation**
	- studying people "in the wild"
	- watching behavior as it unfolds naturally
	- no attempts of manipulation
	- high external validity 
	- low internal validity (no control over what is happening)

2. **Case Studies**
	- studying a single person or small group of people over extended period of time
	- helpful for providing existence proofs
	- not so helpful for testing hypotheses

3. **Surveys and Self-reports**
	- collect opinions and attitudes
	- reports are more descriptive like personality, mental illness identifying, and interests
	- they are cheap and easy to administer to participants
	- assume high level of self-awareness in respondents
	- assume participants are honest (*malingering* vs *response sets*)
		- pertain to SELF reports and surveys they fill out THEMSELVES

	- rating data (a familiar other providing a report)
		- *halo effect* and *horns effect* (judgements)

4. **Correlational Designs**
	- how are 2 variables associated?
	- allow us to "forecast" behavior
	- describe the correlation as positive, negative, or zero

	- beware of:
		- *illusory correlations*
		- *correlation vs. causation*

5. **Experimental Designs**
	- two necessary characteristics

	1. ***Random Assignment*** - put participants in experimental groups 
		- not the same as random selection 

	2.  ***Independent Variables*** - manipulated to create different "levels"
		- examine effects of each level on dependent variable (operationally defined)

	- Beware of :
		- *CONFOUNDING variables* - anything that differs between experimental and control group(s) and is not the independent variable (ex. a third variable) 

		- *placebo effects* - improvement resulting from expectation of improvement

		- *experimenter expectancy effects*
			- researchers hypotheses unintentionally bias study's outcome

		- *demand characteristics*
			- participant's sense cues leading them to generate guesses regarding experimental hypotheses
