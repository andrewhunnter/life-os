### Social development in Infancy and Childhood
- **Temperament**: basic emotional style appearing early in development
	- largely genetic origin; largely stable across infancy (Bornstein, 2015)
	- easy, difficult, slow-to-warm-up, or a hybrid
- Stranger anxiety (~8-9 months)
- Attachment: emotional connection with those to whom we feel closet. (baby and parents/primary caregivers)
	- *secure*: move leaves (upset), mom returns (consoled)
	- *insecure-avoidant*: mom leaves (indifferent), mom returns ( indifferent)
	- *insecure-anxious*: mom leaves (upset), mom returns (mixed reaction)
	- *disorganized*: inconsistent and confused responses

### Influence of Parenting on Development
- Baurmind (1971) and Maccoby & Martin (1983)
	1. *Permissive Lenient*: little to no discipline
	2. *Authoritarian*: Strict, frequent discipline, little outward affection displayed
	3. *Authoritative*: supportive and affectionate but set/enforce clear and firm rules
	4. *Uninvolved*: ignore children, pay little to no attention to positive or negative behaviors
- Providing the ***average expectable environment*** may matter more than parenting style

### Building an Identity: Erikson's 8 Stages
- **IDENTITY**: sense of who we are + life goals and priorities
- Erik Erikson: Identity development is continuous
- Broken down into 8 stages with distinct psychosocial crises
	- difficulty resolving earlier crises heightens risk for later identity confusion

### Building an Identity
- Gender Identity: sense of being male or female

- Evidence for nature
	- toy preferences (~1 year or less) and (Alexander & Seanz, 2012)
	- Segregation in play (~3 years) (LaFreniere, 1984)

- Evidence for nurture
	- parent encouragement of gender-stereotyped behaviors (Lilienfeld, 2023)
	- Teacher-student interactions as positive reinforcement (Serbin & O'Leary 1975)

### Moral Development
- Begins in childhood
	- fear-based (avoidance of punishment)
- Piaget: follows trajectory of understanding of intentions
- Lawrence Kohlberg: moral development as a product of reasoning processes (why?)

- Moral dilemmas:
	- Pre-conventional morality: focus on *reward/punishment*
	- Conventional morality: focus on *societal values*
	- Post-conventional morality: focus *on internal moral values*

### Life Transitions in Adulthood
- Careers
- Long Term commitment
- Parenthood
- Midlife transitions
	- midlife crisis
	- empty-nest syndrome
