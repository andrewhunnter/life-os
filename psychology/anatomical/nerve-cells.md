### relating neurons to PSYCHOLOGY

- they are responsible for sending and receiving information across neurotransmitters in the [[brain]]

- communication across neurons results in behaviors which be be observed and tested with [[psychology]]

### Neurons overview

**THE SOMA**:
- Cell body (*life source* of the neuron)
- Contains the cell's nucleus
- Manufactures cell proteins
- renews cell molecules

**DENDRITES**:
- receive information from other neurons 
- "listen in" and pass messages to soma

**AXON:
- tail-like extension
- sends messages to neighboring neurons via action potential

**AXON TERMINALS**:
- knob-like structures at end of axon
- contain synaptic vesicles (hold neurotransmitters)

**SYNAPSE**:
- interface between two neurons
- point of information exchange

**SYNAPTIC CLEFT**:
- gap between cells
- crossed by neurotransmitters

### Electrical Activity in the Neuron

- Involves movement of particles (Na+, K+) across membrane
- resting potential: baseline
- threshold of excitation: sufficient electrical charge inside cell 
- Action potential - rapid increase (and subsequent decrease) of positive charge
- Absolute refractory period - action potential cannot occur

### Neurotransmission

- Neurotransmitters bind to receptor sites on dendrites
- Specific receptors on dendrites recognize specific neurotransmitters (Lock and Key)
- Re uptake halts neurotransmission

### Neurotransmitters

1. **INHIBITORY** - decrease nervous system activity
2. **EXCITATORY** - increase nervous system activity

Common neurotransmitters
- *Glutamate*: Learning / Memory
- *GABA*: Learning, memory, and sleep
- *Acetylcholine*: Muscle Contraction, attention, memory
- *Monoamines*: motivation & consciousness/alertness (dopamine and serotonin)
- *Anandamide*: Eating, motivation, memory, sleep
- *Neuropeptides*: Endorphins (pain reduction)

### Glial Cells
- "glue" cells that help make up nervous system
- create new and protect existing neurons

1. **Astrocytes**
	- Neuron message transmission
	- Thought, memory, immune system
	- Blood-brain barrier: the brain's security system
2. **Oligodendrocytes**
	- Promote new connections + heal cell damage
	- Produce myelin sheath


### Neural Plasticity
- nervous system's ability to change over time

1. **DEVELOPMENT**
	- growth: synapto-genesis or pruning (myelination)
2. **LEARNING**
	- new synaptic connections potentiation
	- structural plasticity
3. **INJURY & DEGENERATION**
	- regeneration is limited - responsibility reassignment
