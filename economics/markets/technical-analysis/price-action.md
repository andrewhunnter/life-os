### what is price action?
- is the movement of a securities price plotted over time
- price action forms the basis for all technical analyses of a stock, commodity, or other [[assets]]

### understanding price action
- traders use different chart compositions to improve their ability to spot and interpret trends, breakouts, and reversals
- many traders use candle stick charts since they help better visualize price movements by displaying the open, high, low, and close values in the context of up or down sessions
- in combination with visual data, traders can also use price action data when calculating technical indicators

### how to use price action...
- not generally seen as a trading tool, but rather *the data source* which all tools are built

### important patterns in price action...
1. **SUPPORT**: think of support as a [[price-floor]]... It's a price level where a stock tends to stop falling and may bounce back up
	- These levels show where buyers and sellers are most active... breaking through #support or #resistance can signal a big move

2. **RESISTANCE**: think of resistance as a [[price-ceiling]]... it's a price level where a stock often stops rising and may drop back down
	- These levels show where buyers and sellers are most active... breaking through support or resistance can signal a big move

3. **TREND LINES**: a trend line drawn along highs or lows used to help you visualize the direction of the market

4. **CHANNELS**: parallel lines above and below price that can indicate where prices are likely to bounce until a breakout occurs

5. **REVERSAL PATTERNS**: they are time-tested patterns that often coincide with a change in market sentiment

	- *double top*: indicates a potential reversal from an uptrend to a downtrend when the price fails to break a previous high twice
	- *double bottom*: indicates a reversal from a downtrend to an uptrend when the price test a low twice and then rises
	- *head and shoulders*: a classic reversal pattern signaling that an uptrend may be ending
	- *inverse head and shoulders*: signals a potential reversal from downtrend to uptrend

6. **CONTINUATION PATTERNS**: can provide excellent entry points to ride the ongoing trend

	- *triangles* (symmetrical, ascending, and descending): these indicate consolidation before the price breaks out in the direction of the prevailing trend
		- ascending (has a resistance to break through)
		- descending (has a support to break through)

	- f*lags and pennants*: these pattern form after a sharp price move and suggest that the trend is likely to continue after a brief pause


7. **CANDLESTICK**:
	- *doji*: a doji forms when a candle's open and close are nearly the same, resulting in a very short body with long shadows
		- it demonstrates ***indecision***... showing that buyers and sellers are in balance

	- *hammer* : a small body at the top with a long lower shadow, appearing in a downtrend
		- it suggest that although sellers drove prices down, buyers stepped in and pushed price back up marking the start of an upward reversal

	- *hanging man*: similar to hammer, but appearing in an uptrend
		-  it indicates that selling pressure is emerging at the top... and an uptrend may be losing momentum

	- *engulfing patterns*: a small candle followed by a larger candle that completely "engulfs" the previous one
		- bullish engulfing - suggest buyer have taken control after a downtrend
		- bearish engulfing - indicates sellers are overpowering buyers after an uptrend
