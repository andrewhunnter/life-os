### who makes up the population in economics?
- the population divided into two broad groups:

1. ***the working age population:*** is the total number of people aged 16 years and over who are not in jail, hospital, or some other form of institutional care. 

	- ***labor force:*** sum of the employed and unemployed persons 
	- those not in the labor force (neither employed or unemployed)

2. those too young too work or live in institutions (unable to work)

### unemployed vs. employed
- to count as unemployed... you must be in one of three categories

1. without work but has made specific efforts to find a job within the previous four weeks.
2. waiting to be called back to a job from which he or she has been laid off
3. waiting to start a new job within 30 days

### obtaining value from the population...
- [[unemployment]] indicators... are used to assess the status of the population
