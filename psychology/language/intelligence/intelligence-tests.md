### Calculation of IQ
- Drafted by Wilhelm Stem (1912)
- Mental Age / Chronological Age x 100
- Test Performance of Average Person / Age in years x 100
- **PROBLEM**: chronological age continues to increase but mental age levels off at ~16 years (Eysenck, 1994)
	- *Deviation IQ* is the solution... IQ expressed relative to population average (age group norms)

### Early IQ Testing in the United States
- TLDR: A hot mess (started handing tests out left and right)
- Sir Francis Galton: Eugenics (1910s-1930s)
	- Immigration restrictions
	- Sterilization laws in 33 US States

### IQ Testing Today
- Weschler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) - ADULTS
	- 15 "subsets" yielding 5 major scores
- Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) - Children and Adolescents
- Weschler Primary and Preschool Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) - Children 2-7 years

### Culture-Fair IQ Tests
- Designed to overcome language-dependence and/or specific cultural knowledge in IQ testing
- Raven's Progressive Matrices (Raven , 1998)
	- Useful across cultures but not totally generalizable (Oakland, 2013)

### Reliability and Validity of IQ Scores
- Not fixed, but still highly reliable
	- exception: childhood (prior to 2-3 years)
- Demonstrate validity
	- correlated with other IQ tests given at same time (concurrent validity)... Weschler 1998
	- predictive validity
		- Academic success (Neisser, 1996)
		- Occupational performance (Cheng, 2012)
		- Risk for crime (Lubinski, 2004)
		- Negative health-related outcomes (Wraw, 2015)

### Flynn Effect
- Increase of IQ scores over time
	- ~3 points per decade
- Possible product of:
	- Testing experience
	- Complexity of our environment
	- Improvements in nutrition
	- Smaller families and longer academic careers
