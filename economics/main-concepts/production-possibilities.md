### production possibilities and opportunity cost
- **Production possibilities frontier** (PPF): is the boundary between those combinations of goods and services that can be produced and those that cannot
- In order to visualize PPF, one needs to look at a model economy which represent any pair of goods and services

### PPF visual of any pair of goods and services

- The graph is separates the attainable from the unattainable. If there are points located within the attainable (like a point z), they are deemed *inefficient* because resources are wasted or misallocated.

- The PPF graph also illustrates the core [[economics]] concept of #scarcity. This is because points outside the frontier are unattainable.

- PPF also deals with tradeoffs... another all tradeoffs involve a cost-- an [[opportunity-cost]]

### Linear vs Bowed out PPF
- a linear PPF (constant opportunity costs) arise when all resources are suited to producing both goods

### Production Efficiency
- The goal is to produce goods and services at the lowest possible cost (aka **production efficiency**)

- Production Efficiency is all the points along the PPF line, and anything on the inside is deemed *inefficient* (resources are either unused or misallocated)
	- unused: when resources are idle but could be working
	- misallocated: when assigned tasks are not assigned with the the best match


### using resources efficiently

- production efficiency is achieved at every point along the PPF line

> at which point are goods and services are produced in quantities that provide the greatest possible **benefit**

- when goods and services are produced at the lowest possible cost and in the quantities that provide the greatest possible benefit, we have achieved **allocative efficiency**

- **MARGINAL COST**: is the opportunity cost of producing one more unit
	- it is calculated from the slope of PPF

### marginal benefit

- **MARGINAL BENEFIT**: is the benefit received from consuming one more unit of it (it is subjective to the consumer)

- #marginal-benefit curves are unrelated to the PPF and cannot be derived from it

- we measure the #marginal-benefit of a good or service by the most people are willing to pay for an additional unit of it. (you are willing to pay less for a good than it is worth to you but you are not willing to pay for an additional unit of it)

- #marginal-benefit  means to "get old" or "get sick of" the same unit
