### Long-term potentiation (LTP)
- gradual strengthening of neural connections over time (Bliss, 2004)
	- consequence of repetitive network firing
- enhances release of glutamate (Lisman & Raghavachari, 2007)

### Biology of Implicit and Explicit memory
- researchers study patients with amnesia
	1. Anterograde: lost capacity to form new memories
	2. retrograde: lost capacity to retrieve memories from the past
- Henry Molaison (H.M.) and Clive Wearing
	- critical role of hippocampus in explicit memory

### Biology of Emotional Memory (tied to limbic system)
- Amygdala + hippocampus
	- Amygdala: *emotional* component
	- Hippocampus: *factual* component
		- S.M. and W.S
			- Brain damage dictated memory for factual vs. emotional information

### Biology of Memory Deterioration
- Tissue loss (Resnick, 2003)
	- reduction in cortical area between ages 59 and 84
- Alzheimer's disease
	- estimated that 1 American will develop AD every 33 seconds by 2050
	- memory and language-related deficits
	- senile plagues + neurofibrillary tangles
		- result in neuron death
