> at the core of [[user-experience]] and [[user-interface]] is human decision making
### Understanding Human Decision Making
 there are a couple factors that dictate decision making

1. **COGNITIVE BIASES:** mental shortcuts or patterns
2. **EMOTIONS:** utilizing both positive and negative emotions
3. **INFORMATION OVERLOAD:** don't stress users with information
### Decision making models

- *Compensatory model:* helps users make informed decisions
	- Components that guide an ecommerce sale.

- *Non-compensatory model*: satisfy the user needs without sale in mind
	- Website accessibility and privacy options are apart of the user-experience and don't guide the user to a point of sale, but make the overall experience more satisfactory.

- *Satisficing model*: using design to solve for ease of use, rather than purpose
	- An example would be finding a restaurant versus the **best** restaurant. It meets the minimum criteria set by the user and doesn't perform much analysis. 

### Design principles for Supporting Decision Making

- ***Progressive disclosure:*** information to gradually avoid overwhelming users. (labels, tool tips, and expanding sections)

- ***Cognitive aids:*** helps users remember information or tasks by providing timely reminders, notifications, and visual cues.

- ***Feedback:*** instant feedback can help users understand the results of their decisions and guide them toward desired outcomes. (visual cues, messages, and animations)

- ***Defaults***: use smart defaults to help users make decisions in a context-appropriate manner, which could range pre-filled forms to suggested options
