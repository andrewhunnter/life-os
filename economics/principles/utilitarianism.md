### What is utilitarianism?
- is a principle that states that we should strive to achieve "the greatest happiness for the greatest number", by having income be transferred from the rich to the poor up to the point of complete equality

### The Big Tradeoff
- recognizing the costs of making income transfers leads to what is called the "big tradeoff", which is a tradeoff between #efficiency and fairness

### The symmetry principle
- is the requirement that people in similar situations be treated similarly.
