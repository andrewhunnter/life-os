### basic business structures
- **corporation** is a company that is *legally separate* from its owners. (for example an [[limited-liability-company]]]) The advantage of legally separate is that stockholders have limited liability.

- **sole proprietorship** is a business owned by *one person*

- **partnership** is a business owned by *two or more persons*.

(neither sole proprietorship nor partnerships offer limited liability)


### how does this relate to [[financial-accounting]]?

- corporations have double-taxation (tax paying entity)
	- corporate income tax on their profit
	- when distributing as dividends to owners
- corporations can also retain profit for further expansions
