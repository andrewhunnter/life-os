### Smell and Taste
- Smell: Olfaction
	- airborne chemicals interact with receptors in nasal passages
	- lock-and-key concept
- Humans can detect 2,000-4,000 different odors
- Taste: gustation
	- Papillae (contain taste buds)
	- Sweet, salty, sour, butter, and umami (+ fatty)

### Perception of Smell and Taste
- Smell: olfactory bulb (where smells are processed)
	- Olfactory cortex and limbic system
- Taste: taste buds send info to brain
	- Gustatory + somatosensory cortices and limbic system (emotional memories)
- Smell/taste information converge in orbiofrontal cortex
- role in emotional disorders and sexual behavior (Heath et al., 2006, Wyatt, 2017)

### When We Can't Smell or Taste
- Gradual loss is part of aging process
	- failure to replace old/dead taste buds
- Diabetes or high blood pressure
- Brain Damage
	- Olfactory nerve damage
	- Parkinson's or Alzhiemer's-related atrophy (Zou et al, 2016)
