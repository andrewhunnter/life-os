> algorithms that computers can read

### What are computer programs?
- Are algorithms written in code (via specific programming language)
	- A set of instructions for a computer to **process** and **manipulate** data
	- multiple [[algorithms]] make a computer program
### **Architecture** of computer programs:
- programs are algorithms comprised of lines of code
	- code is broken down into a couple **foundational logic concepts:**
		- Mathematical Calculations
		- Comparisons (Decision-Making)
		- Conditional Statements
		- Loops 

### What is the **purpose** of computer programs?
- to orchestrate each of the part of a machine
	- these are the hardware components of  a machine's [[bare-metal-architecture]]
