> people can produce for themselves all the goods and services that they consume, or they can produce one good or a few and **TRADE** with others


### Comparative Advantage and Absolute Advantage
- #comparative-advantage: is an activity where a person can perform the activity at a lower #opportunity-cost  than anyone else

- #absolute-advantage: a person who is more productive than others has absolute advantage (involves comparing productivities over opportunity costs)

**EXAMPLE**

1. John Grisham is a better lawyer and a better author of fast-paced thrillers than most people . He has an *absolute advantage* in these two activities, but he is a better writer than lawyer which is his *comparative advantage*
