> the memory assembly line

### How memory works...
- **memory**: retention of information over time
	- performs very well in many situations
	- can fail us when we least expect it
		- Rajan Mahadevan

### Reconstructive Nature of Memory
- During recall, events are actively reconstructed (not passively reproduced)
	- based on cues and other available information
- memories *are not exact* "photocopies" of past events (van der kolk, 1984)
- outside observer perspective during recall as evidence of memory reconstruction
	- influence of beliefs, moods, expectations, cultural narratives (Wang, 2021)

### Types of memory
- "memory" is not a single entity... broken down into 3 major types
1. sensory memory
2. short-term memory (working memory)
3. long-term memory

- how ***MUCH***... terms of span & capacity
- how ***LONG***... duration

### Atkinson-Shiffrin Model of Memory
- flows from sensory input into short-term memory, which will either encode or retrieve long-term memory
- think of it as an "assembly line" with multiple stops


## SENSORY MEMORY (first stop)
- the "raw material" of experience
- short-term store that acts as a buffer
- specific type dedicated to each sense
	1. *Iconic Memory*: visual sensory memory
		- extremely brief ~1 second
		- eidetic memory: "photographic" memory
	2. *Echoic memory*: auditory sensory memory
		- up to 5-10 seconds

## SHORT-TERM MEMORY (second stop)
- the "construction" zone
- ~20 seconds or less (Peterson & Peterson, 1959)
- Nowadays referred to as **"working"** memory
	- holds information we are actively attending to or processing (Baddeley & Hitch, 1974)
- why are short term memories lost so quickly?
	- **DECAY** - memories fade over time (Kitamura, 2009)
	- **INTERFERENCE** - memories get in the way of each other (Waugh & Norman, 1965)
		- RETROACTIVE : new interferes with old
		- PROACTIVE : old interferes with new
			- *greater impact when old/new information is similar*
- capable of holding 7 +- 2 pieces of information at a time
	- Miller's "Magic Number" (Miller, 1956)
- improving short-term memory performance...
	- *capacity*: chunking
	- *duration*: rehearsal
		- maintenance: no change to original stimulus
			- involves repetition
		- elaborative: 'elaborating' on stimulus

### Levels of processing (Craik & Lockhart, 1972)
- visual/structural
	- how does the stimulus look?
- phonological/acoustic (sound-related)
	- how does stimulus sound?
- semantic (meaning-related)
	- what does the stimulus mean? 
	- deeper processing = longer-lasting memories (craik & tulving, 1975)

## LONG-TERM MEMORY
- relatively enduring store of information
	- facts, experiences, skills
	- years, decades, or permanently ("permastore")... Bahrick & Phelps, 1987
- large capacity
	- as much information as 500 online encyclopedias! (Cordon, 2005) 

![[longterm.excalidraw]]

1. **Explicit** (declarative) memory: intentional recall
	- *semantic* memory: facts abut the world (tulving)
	- *episodic* memory: personal experiences
2. **Implicit** memory: recall without conscious effort
	- *procedural memory*: memory for motor skills (brushing teeth)
	- *priming*: exposure to one stimulus influences response to subsequent stimulus (cat and m_u_e... or cat to mule)
	- *habituation*: decreased response to repeated stimulus

### SHORT & LONG TERM: Primacy and Recency Effects
- tendency to recall words at the beginning (primacy) or end (recency) of a studied word list
	- primacy: long-term memory - elaborative rehearsal
	- recency: short-term memory - working memory storage
- % correct recall is plotted on "serial position curve"
