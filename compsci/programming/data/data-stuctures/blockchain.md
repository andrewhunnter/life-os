> a method for creating secure and commoditized data for [[defi]]
### What is the blockchain
- think of it as a fascinating train journey, with each block representing a carriage and the chain forming the train itself

- each block can only hold a **limited** amount of data before it's considered full (like a train car)

- each block also carries a **timestamp**, which tells us *when* the data in that block was recorded and stored.

- it is [[data-structure]] that can be compared to a glorified distributed ledger

### Breaking down the blockchain:

1. THE BLOCK
	- every block hold three main components:
			a. Data
				- different blockchains store different types of data
			b. The ***hash*** of the *current and previous* block
				- the hash is a unique fingerprint or ID

2. THE CHAIN
	- because each block contains the current hash and proceeding hash, the form the **chain** like structure.

### How many copies of a blockchain are there?
- there isn't a #centralized-authority holding a master copy of the blockchain
- INSTEAD there are multiple copies spread across a decentralized network of computers called [[nodes]].

### How are blockchains so secure?
- transactions are **openly** displayed on the blockchain

### FLASHCARDS
Easiest way to visualize the blockchain?:: each block is a **carriage** and the link is a **train**. Like actual train carriages, data like people can *fill* a carriage.

How much data can each block hold?:: the amount of data each block can hold is **limited**
<!--SR:!2024-04-26,2,210-->

What is in a block?:: There is data (different per blockchain), the current hash, and previous hash
