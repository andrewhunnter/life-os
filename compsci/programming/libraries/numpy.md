### what is numpy?
- one of the many [[python]] [[libraries]] designed for high performance numerical computing

### what is the purpose of numpy
- it provides support for large, multi-dimensional #array(s) and #matrices, alogn with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. 

### "use case" of numpy
- think of numpy as the "spreadsheet calculator" of [[python]]. 
- just as you might use excel for number crunching, numpy lets you perform operations on large datasets quickly
