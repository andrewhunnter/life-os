### constructing a graph from a dataset
- there are varying types of plot you can derive from a dataset:
	- **line plots**: best for showing trends over time or ordered categories
	- **bar charts:** useful for comparing quantities across different categories
	- **scatter plots:** great for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables
	- **pie charts:** use for showing proportions, but use caution as they can be misleading
	- **area charts**: similar to line plots, but filled below the line to show volume
	- **error bars**: include variability or uncertainty  in your data
### [[libraries]] for data visualization
- seaborn - a [[python]] data visualization library based on [[matplotlib]]. they provide a #high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. 
- plotly - similar to seaborn and would argue has better visuals and aesthetic appeal
