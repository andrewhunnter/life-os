### The nervous system in action...
> the core biology involved in [[psychology]]

1. Central - spinal cord and [[brain]]
	- must be protected to **SUSTAIN LIFE**
	- Meninges - thin layers of membranes surrounding brain and spinal cord
	- Cerebral ventricles - pockets filled with cerebrospinal fluid

2. Peripheral - [[nerve-cells]] outside CNS (not brain or spine)

3. Autonomic - non-voluntary body functions 
	- sympathetic and parasympathetic actions
	- neurons tend to fire together
	- coordination is critical
	- parasympathetic actions like rest and digestion
	- can stimulate flight or fight

4. Somatic - voluntary behaviors
	- *intentional* actions
	-  nerves carry messages from brain to body musculature (stabilization)

### Breaking down parts of the [[brain]]

- **THE CEREBRAL CORTEX**
	- Largest most developed component of the forebrain (lots of neurons can be found)
	- analyzes *sensory* information
	- capacity for reasoning and language
	- divided into 2 hemispheres (both work together, but are lateralized to a degree)

1. **FRONTAL LOBE** - *executive functioning*
	- motor cortex (central sulcus)
	- speech production (Broca's area)
	- decision making
	- personality
	- self-awareness 

2. **TEMPORAL LOBE** - *processing language*
	- hearing
	- separated by lateral fissure
	- language comprehension
	- conscious long-term memory
	- object recognition 

3. **PARIETAL LOBE** - *processing touch and space*
	- somatosensory cortex (pressure, pain, temperature)
	- spatial awareness
	- attention
	- numbers

4. **OCCIPITAL LOBE** - *processing vision*
	- dedicated to vision
	- color differentiation
	- form
	- motion
	- depth perception

5. **THE BASAL GANGLIA** - *movement control*
	- help to control movement
	- goal-driven actions
	- emotion and language
	- decision making
	- learning and memory

6. **THE LIMBIC SYSTEM** - *emotional control*
	- thalamus - sensory relay station
	- hypothalamus - internal bodily states (homeostasis)
	- amygdala - emotion-based modulation of memory/motivation
	- hippocampus - learning and memory

7. **THE CEREBELLUM** - *balance and coordination*
	- learning motor skills
	- language and memory
	- spatial processing
	- executive processing
	- executive abilities

8. **THE BRAIN STEM** - *maintain life functions*
	- basic body functions that maintain life
	- midbrain (movement, visual tracking, reflexes triggered by sound)
	- pons - connection to cerebellum
	- medulla - breathing, heart beat, and nausea/vomiting
