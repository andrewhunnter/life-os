> interest rates & bond yields

### interest rates
- the cost of borrowing money
- set by central banks (like the Federal Reserve) and **influenced** by market forces

### bond yields
- the return investors earn from holding bonds
- for example, the US10YR treasury yield is the interest rate on government bonds that mature in 10 years
	- a benchmark for long-term interest rates
	- ***influences*** mortgage rates, corporate borrowing costs, and overall economic sentiment

### how do they influence [[stock-market]] prices

- **discounting cash flows:** companies like growth tech companies, are often valued based on the present value of their expected future earnings... when interest rates or bond yields rise, the discount rate increases
	- higher discount rates lower the present value of future earnings, leading to lower valuations
	- forces companies to ***use money quick***, or lose to discount rate for a better ROI

- **cost of borrowing:**  higher interest rates mean companies pay more to borrow money, which can slow down expansion and reduce profits

- **investor preference:** when bond yields rise, bonds become more attractive compared to stocks... leading to a shift in investor preference from stocks to bonds, driving stock prices down.

- **economic signal:** rising yields can signal expectations of inflation or stronger economic growth, which might lead to tighter monetary policy... however, if yields rise too quickly, it could dampen economic growth and hurt market sentiment
