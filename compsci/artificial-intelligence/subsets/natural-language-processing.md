a subset of [[artificial-intelligence]] that focuses on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. (aka known as NLPs)

### What is the GOAL of NLPs: 
- The primary goal of NLP subset is to **bridge the gap** between *human communication* and *computer understanding*, allowing computers to interact with and process natural language data.

### What NLPs can DO:
- **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or phrases (tokens), to facilitate further analysis.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging** (POS): Assigning grammatical categories (such as noun, verb, adjective) to each word in a sentence
- **Named Entity Recognition** (NER): Identifying and classifying entities (such as names of people, organizations, locations) within a text
- **Syntax and Grammar Analysis**: Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to understand the relationship between words
- **Semantics**: Analyzing the meaning of words and sentences in context, including word sense and disambiguation
- **Pragmatics**: Dealing with the interpretation of language in context, considering the speaker's intentions and implied meanings
- **Speech Recognition**: Converting spoken language into written text, enabling machines to process and respond to spoken commands
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another, facilitating cross-language communication
- **Text Summarization**: Generate concise and coherent summaries of longer texts, capturing the main points
- **Question Answering**: Understanding and responding to user queries, often information from a knowledge base
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotional tone or sentiment express in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral
- **Text Generation**: Creating human-like text based on specific instructions or prompts

### Applications of NLPs:
- NLPs can be found in various industries and domains
	- customer service via chatbots
	- information retrieval for healthcare, finance, and more
