### what is social entrepreneurship?
- the process of identifying pressing social and environmental problems in society and create sustainable solutions for positive and long-term impact 
	- an organization formed on this premise is known as a **social venture**
	- often pressing social and environmental problems know as **wicked problems**

### different types of social ventures
- **for-profit social venture**: is a a business that has a dual mission, aiming to achieve both social or environmental objectives and financial sustainability. 
	- generating economic value while provided solutions to social and environmental problems is known as **shared value**.
- **enterprising nonprofits:** are non profit organizations that at more like for-profit ventures. They operate with a mission to address social or environmental challenges and create positive impact, yet sustain themselves through forms of revenue generation that are more similar to those of for-profit companies.
	- they incorporate **earned-income activities**, those that involve the sale of products or services that are used as a source of revenue generation.

### funding social ventures
- **Social Venture Capital (SVC)**: also known as impact investing, is a form of investment funding that focuses on for-profit social ventures with a social or environmental mission. 

### role of stakeholders
- one characteristic of wicked problems is that diverse groups of people are needed to buy in to be involved with solutions.
- social ventures have **stakeholders** - people, groups, or organizations affected by or involved with the venture.
	- includes employees, volunteers, investors, customers, suppliers, and manufacturers.

### types of stakeholders:
- To determine the most important stakeholders adopt the **salience model** (breaks stakeholders down into 3 categories)
	- *Power* - the ability to help or hinder your social objectives
	- *Legitimacy* - those whose actions are appropriate, proper, and desired in the context of the company/organization
	- *Urgency* - the extent to which stakeholders demand your attention
- stakeholders are **not static**, and can evolve over time

DORMAN STAKEHOLDERS:
- hold *power*, but do not tend to use that power unless they are given a reason too

DISCRETIONARY STAKEHOLDERS:
- have no power to influence and no urgent claims... but have *legitimacy*

DEMANDING STAKEHOLDERS:
- demanding stakeholders possess *urgency*. They have no power or legitimacy and may be the only dissenting voice in the room.

DOMINANT STAKEHOLDERS:
- dominant stakeholders have both *power* and *legitimacy*

DEPENDENT STAKEHOLDERS:
- have both *urgency* and *legitimacy*... but lack power and influence

DANGEROUS STAKEHOLDERS:
- possess both *power* and *urgency*

DEFINITIVE STAKEHOLDERS:
- possess all 3 attributes... *power*, *legitimacy*, and *urgency*
