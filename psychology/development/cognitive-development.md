### The Developing Mind
- 3 core differences:

1. Stage-like changes vs. continuous changes
	- Mental "growth spurts" vs. gradual growth
2. Domain-general vs. domain-specific account of development
	- All aspects of cognition improve together vs. independently
3. Source of learning
	- Physical world vs. social interaction vs. biological maturation

### Jean Piaget's Stages of Development
- development marked by radical reorganization
	- followed by period of stability in thinking
	- domain-general
- learning from physical environment
- end goal of development: ability to reason logically about *hypothetical* problems
- reorganization of thinking at each stage achieves equilibration
	- balance between personal experience and logical understanding
	- balance assimilation and (when necessary) accommodation

> Increase ability to think abstractly

1. **sensorimotor**r (0-2 years)
	- the infant explores the world through direct sensory and motor contact. Object permanence and separation
2. **pre operational** (2-6 years)
	- The child uses symbols (words and images) to represent objects but does not reason logically. The child also has the ability to pretend. During this stage , the child is egocentric
3. **Concrete Operational** (7-12 years)
	- The child can think logically about concrete objects and can thus add and subtract . The child also understand conversation
4. **Formal Operational** (12 years - adult)
	- The adolescent can reason abstractly and think in hypothetical terms

### Cognitive Landmarks in Early Development
- Physical reasoning
	- object permanence: objects exist even when out of view (~5 months)
- Use of categorization
	- Dissimilar appearance lack of conceptual relationship
- Formulation of self-concept
	- recognizing self as distinct from others
	- other people may not know what I know (theory of mind)

### Lev Vygotsky's Theory of Development
- Learning happens through social interaction
	- Scaffolding
	- Gradual removal of learning assistance as children become more competent
	- unable to learn... zone of proximal development
- did not endorse domain-general stages
	- argued that skill mastery happens on individual basis

### Language Acquisition
- Starts before birth (Moon, 2013)
- First year of life
	- Phonemes (native language sounds)
	- Use of vocal apparatus of intentionally produce sound.. babbling
- learning words and syntax... comprehension precedes production 
	- mistakes of over/under-extension (words)
	- evolution from 1-word speech to multiple-word over time
- no evidence of a "critical period"... "sensitive period" is more accurate (Lilienfeld, 2023)
- high degree of variability in timeline
- why do adults struggle?
	- less is more hypothesis (Newport, 2001)
	- Bottom-up vs. top-down processing
	- adults add too much structure

### Theoretical Accounts of Language Acquistion
- Imitation
	- Language learned by copying adults
	- Incomplete explanation because language is generative
- nativist account
	- children are born with basic knowledge of language
	- language acquisition device
- language development coincides with increase of general cognitive capacities


### Cognitive Changes in Adolescence
- Continued maturation of frontal lobes
	- Impulsive behavior
	- Heightened suscepbibillity to peer influence (Steinberg, 2007) 
		- Increased activity of limbic system... *reward sensitivity*

### Cognitive Function in Adulthood
- Many aspects of cognitive function decline with age
	- information recall 
	- processing speed
- decrease in overall brain volume
- some aspects of cognition are spared
	- cued recall/recognition
	- recall of material pertinent to everyday life
	- crystallized intelligence
