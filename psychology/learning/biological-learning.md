> Facilitating Learned Associations

### Preparedness and Phobias
- Preparedness: phobias in absence of frightening experience are "evolutionary memories"
	- posed a threat to human ancestors (Hofmann, 2008)
- Findings may be result of latent inhibition
	- Common objects/situations resistant to conditioning due to previous experience (Luck, 2019)

### Instinctive Drift
- return to innate behaviors following repeated reinforcement (Burgos, 2015)
- an example would be a pet tiger *going rouge* (tiger king)
