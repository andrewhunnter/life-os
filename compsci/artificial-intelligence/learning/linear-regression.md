> a method within supervised learning for predicting continuous values and finding a linear relationship 
### breaking down linear regression
- finding the **best-fit line**
	- the algorithm calculates the line that best fits the data points
- **coefficients**
	- these numbers tell you much feature (like size) influences the outcome (price)
- **intercepts**
	- this is the starting point of the line when all features are zero

### linear regression and #programming 
- because linear regression is a supervised [[machine-learning]] algorithm, [[python]] is the most optimal #language with powerful [[libraries]]

### popular applications of linear regression

- predictive analytics: forecasting trends like house prices, stock prices, or sales (for example [[stock-analysis]] can use it)

- econometrics: understanding economic relationships (how income affects spending)

- risk management: estimating risk factors in finance

- simple machine-learning baseline
