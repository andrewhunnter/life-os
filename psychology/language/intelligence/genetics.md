> Individual and Group differences
### Genetics, Environment, and IQ
- natura vs. nurture

1. **FAMILY STUDIES**
	- Extent to which a characteristic "runs" together intact families
	- similar genetics and shared environment

2. **TWIN STUDIES**
	- Differences in a characteristic between identical and fraternal twins
	- higher vs. lower match in genetics + shared environment
	- monozygotic correlation still not perfect, even when raised together
	- correlation drops further when twins are in different environments

3. **ADOPTION STUDIES**
	- Extent to which a characteristics differs by shared genetics and/or environment
	- similar or dissimilar genetics and shared or unshared environment

### Evidence for Genetic Influence on IQ
- Family studies
- "runs in the family"
- r = 0.45 for siblings

- twin studies
- stronger correlation in monozygotic (identical) twins
- r value is closer to 0.85 and 0.60

- adoption studies
- stronger correlation between adopted child and biological parent than adopted child and adoptive parent

### Additional Evidence for Environmental Influence on IQ
- FAMILY SIZE: small family size associated with slightly higher IQ (Zjonc, 1975)
- SCHOOLING: correlation with IQ (r = 0.5-0.6) (Neisser, 1996)
- EXPECTANCY EFFECTS: Rosenthal and Jacobson 1966... IQ increase observed among "bloomers"
- POVERTY: malnutrition, lack of access, exposure to toxins linked to lower IQ scores (Eysenck & Schoenthaler 1997)

- "GROWTH" vs "FIXED" mindset
	- beliefs about our intelligence and capabilities
	- can influence the experiences we seek out and/or our reactions to challenges

### Group Differences in IQ
- Within-group heritability: genetic influence on variability of trait within the same group
	- does not always imply between-group heritability
- Between-group heritability: genetic influence on variability of trait between different groups


### Group Differences in IQ: Sex
- Few or no average differences in overall IQ (Flynn & Rossi-Case, 2011)
- Some reliable differences noted in specific domains

- **MALE**:
	- geography
	- spatial ability
	- complex mathematical tasks (in adolescence)

- **FEMALE**:
	- reading facial expressions for emotion
	- writing
	- arithmetic calculation (in childhood)

### Group differences in IQ: Race
- General trends
	- African Americans and Hispanic Americans tend to score lower than non-hispanic white Americans (Hunt & Carlson, 2007)
	- Asian Americans tend to score higher than Non-hispanic white Americans (Lynn, 1996)
		- differences between groups decreasing in magnitude over time (Nisbett, 2012)
	- Evidence indicates environmental influences, not genetic (Lilienfeld et al., 2023; Weiss & Salofske, 2020)

### Evidence Against Genetic Explanation for Race Differences
- Family and adoption studies
- Scarr and Weinberg (1976)
	- No IQ differences found between African American adoptees and White siblings by age 11
	- Importance of exposure to school environment and culture of test developers

### Stereotype Threat
- fear of confirming a negative group stereotype
- can-create self-fulfilling prophecy by harming task performance
