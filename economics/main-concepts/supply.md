### What is supply?
if a firm supplies a good or service, the firm:

1. has the resources and technology to produce it
2. can profit from producing it
3. plans to produce it and sell it

### Quantity Supplied
- the amount that producers plan to sell during a given time period at a particular price. The quantity supplied is not necessarily the same amount as the quantity actually sold.

### The Law of Supply

> Other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the greater is the quantity supplied; and the lower the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity supplied.

- this is because #marginal-cost increases

### About the Supply curve:
- it is a curve that shows the lowest price at which someone is willing to sell (which is the #marginal-cost )

### What influences Supply?
- The prices of factors of production (an increase would cause a decrease)
- The prices of related goods produced ( #substitutes in production decrease)
- Expected future prices (hype means decrease in current supply)
- The number of suppliers (more competition means less supply)
- Technology (can increase)
- The state of nature (limited natural resources)

### Supply and Marginal Cost

- #marginal-cost is the minimum price that producers must receive to induce them to offer one more unit of a good or service for sale.

- a supply curve is a #marginal-cost curve

### What is a producer surplus?
- When the price exceeds #marginal-cost, the firm receives a #producer-surplus
