> Reward, punishment, and behavior

### Operant Conditioning
- Controls learning by introducing consequences for behavior (McSweeney & Murphy, 2014)
	- Behavior is shaped by what *follows* it
	- Based on the law of effect (E.L. Thorndike)

> "if a reward follows a response to stimulus, we are more likely to repeat that response in the future"

### Operant vs. [[classical-conditioning]]
- Target behavior...
	- CC - elicited automatically
	- OC - emitted voluntarily
- Reward is...
	- CC - provided unconditionally
	- OC - contingent on behavior
- Behavior depends primarily on...
	- CC - Autonomic Nervous System
	- OC - Skeletal Muscles

### Operant Conditioning Terminology
1. **Reinforcement**: consequence that strengthens probability of a response (makes a behavior more likely to occur)
2. **Punishment**: consequence that weakens probability of a response
	- Positive (+) R or P = adding stimulus
	- Negative (-) R or P = removing stimulus
3. **Discriminative Stimulus**: stimulus that signals presence of reinforcement

### Principles of Operant Conditioning
- acquisition
- extinction
- spontaneous recovery
- stimulus generalization 
- stimulus discrimination

### Schedules of Reinforcement
- The pattern of reinforcement delivery
- Manipulated in two ways:
	1. CONSISTENCY - "fixed" (regular) vs. "variable" (irregular)
	2.  BASIS - "ratio" or (# or response) vs. "interval" (time elapsed)... WHY reinforcing
	   
- Four major schedules of reinforcement:
	1. Fixed ratio (FR): reinforcement after regular # of responses (behavior based = ratio)
		- dog gets treat after performing "roll over" 5 times
	2. Variable ratio (VR): reinforcement after *average* # of responses
		- gambling
	3. Fixed Interval (FI): reinforcement after specified amount of time
		- salaried employees
	4. Variable Interval (VI): reinforcement after *average* time interval
		- Health inspection of a restaurant

### Applications of Operant Conditioning
- Pets (and other animal training)
- Procrastination (*punishment*)
- Clinical Settings
	- Token economies
		- secondary reinforcer (tokens/stickers) - INITAL/FIRST/MOMENT
		- primary reinforcer (food, drink) - BIOLOGICAL NEED


### When [[classical-conditioning]] and Operant Conditioning meet...
- Persistence of fears of anxiety disorders
	- Two-process theory (Mowrer, 1947)
	1. Phobia acquired through *classical conditioning*
		- NS (dog) + (UCS) bite = CR (fear) and CS (dog)
	2. Continued avoidance of CS.. negative reinforcement (*operant conditioning*)
		- continued avoidance of CS (dogs)
