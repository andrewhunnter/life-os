collections of pre-written code that provide reusable functions and tools to simplify and enhance software development

### Why do developers **use** libraries?
1. Code reuse
	- libraries provide access to pre-written, and tested code
	- eliminates repetitive tasks for developers
	- this saves ***TIME*** in development
2. Specialized Functionality 
	- Libraries offer specialized tools for common tasks
	- Developers can use libraries to establish solutions in areas like data processing, graphics, or networking
3. Consistency
	- because developers are re-using code, consistency is promoted within the community, and language.
4. Community
	- fuels and maintains an active community of developers for the vast array of programming languages
