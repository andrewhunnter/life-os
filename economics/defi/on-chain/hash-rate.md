### what is a hash rate?
- the hash rate is a measure of how much computational power is being used by the network, especially in [[blockchain]](s) like [[bitcoin]] that use a proof of work system
- it is usually measured in hashes per second (H/s), which tells you how many calculations the network is performing every second 

### why do hash rates matter?
- security indicator - a higher hash rate means more miners are working to secure the network which makes it harder for any single entity to manipulate or attack the blockchain. 

- confidence in the network - consistently high or growing hash rates suggest that miners are confident in the network's long-term viability
