> Pavlov and his dogs...
### The Discovery of Classical Conditioning
- "British Associationists" (18th/19th century)
	- knowledge is acquired by making associations among stimuli (aka conditioning) (goodwin, 2015)
- Ivan Pavlov
	- research focused on digestion in dogs
	- noted salivation in response to presence of research assistants

### Classical Conditioning Terms
1. Neutral  Stimulus (NS): does not elicit any particular response
2. Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS): Elicits a reflexive/unconditioned response
3. Unconditioned response (UCR): reflexive/unconditioned response to presentation of UCS
4. Conditioned response (CR): previously the UCR, response to presentation of NS after repeated pairings of NS + UCS
5. Conditioned Stimulus (CS): Previously the NS; elicits CR after repeated pairings of NS + UCS

### Pavlov's Classical Conditioning Model
![[pavlovs-conditioning.excalidraw]]
- Breaking down the model...
	- variables: tuning fork (blue), food (green), and salivation.
	- fork = neutral (*needs conditioning*, is neutral stimulus)
	- food = always an unconditioned response which is *salivation*

- TOP RIGHT (step 1)
	- food = unconditioned stimulus
	- dog/salivation = unconditioned response
- TOP LEFT (step 2)
	- fork = neutral stimulus
	- no conditioned response
- BOTTOM LEFT (step 3)
	- fork and associated (pairing)
	- salivation = unconditioned response, which initiates conditioning
- BOTTOM RIGHT (step 4)
	- fork = BECOMES a conditioned stimulus after 3
	- dogs salivates at fork because is it *CONDITIONED NOW*

### Principles of Classical Conditioning
1. Acquisition: gradually learning CR
	- CR strength increases across trials
		- timing impacts speed of acquisition means shorter delay (faster learning)
2. Extinction: gradual disappearance of CR
	- Repeated presentation of CS without UCS
	- New behavior "writes over" original CR
	- Dogs are seen with JUST fork, they will slowly salivate less and less
3. Spontaneous recovery: sudden reappearance of seemingly extinct CR
	- CR was suppressed, not forgotten: Pavlov (1927)
	- implications for therapeutic treatment (e.g. phobias)
	- spontaneously revived the response
		- renewal effect (Bouton, 1994) 
4. Stimulus generalization: similar (but not identical) stimulus to CS elicits CR
	- generalization gradient
		- greater similarity between old/new CS = greater CR
5. Stimulus discrimination: less pronounced CR occurs when new CS differs from original CS

### Higher-Order Conditioning
- Developing CR to neutral stimuli that are associated with original CS (Onuma & Sakai, 2016)
	- Extends classical conditioning to new stimuli
	- strength of conditioning weakens with each progressive level

### Applications of Classical Conditioning
- **Advertising** - possible impact of latent inhibition (Smith, 2001; Palsson, 2005)
	- repeated experience with CS = difficulty to conditioning to new UCS

- **Fears and Phobias**
	- may play a role in phobia development and/or treatment
	- Watson and Rayner (1920): "Little Albert"
	- Jones (1924): "Little Peter"

- **Fetishes**: sexual attraction to nonliving things
	- pairing of neutral objects with sexual activity (Koskal, 2004)

- **Disgust**
	- often tied to stimuli biological importance (Connolly et al, 2008)
		- (Rozin 1990) - "sugar water" and "sodium cyanide poison"

- **Taste Aversions** 
	- differ from typical classical conditioning
		- may require only single "trial"
		- association made even with a delay
		- high degree of *specificity*, little to no generalization
	- often adaptive; but can pose difficulty (cancer treatment)
