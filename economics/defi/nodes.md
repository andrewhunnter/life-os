### What are nodes?
- Each node is a diligent contributor who maintains their own personal copy of the blockchain. 
- The nodes are built to continuously communicate with one another, cross-checking their copies to ensure *everyone has the same set of data*.

### Purpose of nodes
- enables #decentralized-authority because everyone (the nodes) are checking establishing order over each other, rather than #centralized-authority
