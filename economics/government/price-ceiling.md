### What is a price ceiling?
- a government regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than a specified level is called a **price ceiling** or **price cap**.

- set above the equilibrium (has not effect) because it doesn't constrain market forces. 

- when a price ceiling is applied to a housing market, it is called a rent ceilling. A rent ceiling set below the equilibrium rent creates:

	- a housing shortage 
	- increased search activity
	- an illicit market

### When is there a problem?
- rent set below the equilibrium rent, the quantity of housing demanded exceeds the quantity of housing supplied... there is a shortage

- when **search activity** increases, or the time spent looking for someone with whom to do business with.

- rent ceilings also encourage illegal trading in an illicit market, in which the equilibrium price exceeds the price ceiling.
