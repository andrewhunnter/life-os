### What is rhetoric?
- is the deliberate and strategic use of language, style, and persuasive techniques to actively involve and influence an audience.

- has two connotations:

*Pejorative* (disapproval) Connotation:
1. "persuasive speaking" without meaning or substance
	- politicians are often accused of rhetoric when boasting campaigns

*Positive* Connotation:
2. the art, theory, and practice of ethical communication
	- the art of "persuasion"

### Stages of Rhetorical Engagement
- **[[rhetorical-awareness]]:** the process of listening and observing your community and environment for augments

- **Rhetorical Analysis:** breaking an argument into its separate parts to find meaningful patterns

- **Rhetorical Context:** Analyzing an argument within its larger situation (i.e. political, historical, social, and economic)
