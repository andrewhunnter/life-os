### What is elasticity of demand?
- is a units-free measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price when all other influences on buying plans remain the same.

- derives from foundational concept of [[demand]]

### How do you find elasticity?

> price elasticity of demand = % in quantity demanded / % in price

- change in avg quantity **times** average quantity
- change in avg price **times** average price

for example... to calculate the price elasticity of demand for pizza, we need to know the quantity demanded of pizza at **two different prices**, when all other influences on buying plans remain the same.

### Inelastic and Elastic Demand
- if the quantity demanded remains constant when the price changes, then the price elasticity of demand is zero and the good is said to have a perfectly #inelastic demand.

- If the percentage change in the quantity demanded equals the percentage change in the price, then the price #elasticity equals 1 and the good is said to have a unit elastic demand

- if the quantity demanded changes by an infinitely large percentage in response to a tiny price change, then the price elasticity of demand is infinity and the good is said to have **perfectly elastic demand** (a cheaper vending machine)

> if the price is between zero and 1 the good is said to be inelastic

> if the price is over 1 then the good is said to be elastic


### Factors that influence the elasticity of demand
- the closeness of the #substitute 
- the proportion of income spend on the good
- the time elapsed since the price change

### Elasticity of Supply
- just like foundational concept of [[demand]], [[supply]] can also be elastic

what influences supply:
1. elasticity for supply depends on resource substitution possibilities
2. time frame for the supply decision

### time frame for a supply decision
- momentary supply
- short-run supply
- long-run supply

**momentary supply**: when the price of a good changes, the immediate response of the quantity supplied is determined by the *momentary supply* of that good.

**short-run supply**: the response of quantity supplied to a price change when only some of the possible adjustments to production can be made is determined by *short-run supply*.

**long-run supply:** the response of the quantity supplied to a price change after all the technologically possible ways of adjusting supply have been exploited is determined by *long-run supply*.


### What is cross elasticity?

- #cross-elasticity of demand measures the *responsiveness* of the demand for one good to a change in the price of a substitute or a complement, other things remaining the same.
