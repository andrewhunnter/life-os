### html semantics
- html has some semantic elements:
	- head - stores meta data (not visible)
	- body - visible content
	- nav - navigation links
	- main - core page content
	- section - thematic grouping of content
	- article - independent content
- think of html like a tree with nested tags that define the layout
- helps with SEO (search engine optimization)

### block elements
- take up the full width of the parent container
- always start on a new line
- you can set width, height, margin, and padding

### inline
- only take up as much width as their content
- do NOT start on a new line
- can't set width or height

### inline-block
- behave like inline elements (sit on the same line)
- best of both worlds - can set width and height like block
- for buttons, drop downs, and images in a row 

### exploring meta tags
- provides a short summary of the page 
- shown in search results (if relevant)
- doesn't directly boost rankings but can improve click-through-rate (CTR)
