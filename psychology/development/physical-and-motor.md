### Conception and Prenatal Development
1. Zygote (Fertillized egg)
2. Blastocyst (conception to ~1.5 weeks.. germinal stage)
	- ball of identical cells undergoing repeated division
3. Embryo (2-8 weeks: embryonic stage)
	- cells assume different functions
4. Fetus (9 weeks + fetal stage)
	- major organs are established
	- goal from here on out is to "bulk up"

### Potential Obstacles in Fetal Development
- Premature birth: baby is born prior to 36 weeks gestation
- Low birth weight (x<5.5 pounds at full term)
- Exposure to hazardous environmental influences
	- Teratogens (drugs, alcohol, maternal chicken pox, x-rays)
- Errors in cell division (genetic or random)
	- Impaired development of organs or organ system

### Infant Motor Development
- At birth: reflexes
	- Fulfill important survival needs (e.g. rooting)
	- (Swaiman & Ashwal, 1999)
- Eventual acquisition of purposeful motor behavior
	- Sitting up, crawling, standing without support, walking
- Timeline for milestone achievement may depend on:
	1. Physical development and/or body weight (Slining, 2010)
	2. Cultural and parenting practices 
		- Peru & China
		- Africa & West India

### Physical Development Throughout Childhood
- Dramatic change between early childhood and adolescence
	- Ratio of head-to-body size

### Physical Development in Adolescence
- Many of the changes are hormonal in nature
	- Physical growth (pituitary gland)
	- Release of estrogens and androgens
	- Maturation of reproductive systems (puberty)
		- Primary vs. Secondary sex characteristics
	- Noticeable differences in strength and endurance (Buenen & Malina 1996 )

### Physical Development in Adulthood
- "Physical peak" achieved in early 20s (Lindle, 1997)
	- After that...
		- change in muscle tone/body fat ratio
		- decline in sensory processes
		- decline in fertility (females)
			- Menopause
		- Difficulty with tasks requiring complex motor skills (Guan & Wade, 2000)
