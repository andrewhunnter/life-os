Stock Analysis is a strategy used when looking to hold a **long term position** in a company. It is split into two forms of research which are designed narrow down your decision of owning or not.

## 1. Quantitive Analysis (research)
Reviewing a company's financials: Required documents for filing
- U.S. Securities
- Exchange Commission (SEC)

### Important Documents to conduct research:

1. **Form 10-K**: An annual report that includes key financials statements that have been independently audited. Information you can find:
	- *The company's balance sheet*
	- *Sources of income*
	- *Cash management*
	- *Revenue & Expenses*

1. **Form 10-Q**: A quarterly update on operations and financial results
	- *live "updates" of the company to see how it is currently operating*

### Where to conduct quantitive research?
The SEC's Electric Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR) website provides a searchable database for forms like #10-K & #10-Q. It's a valuable resource for learning how to research stocks.


### Understanding the documents 
There are a lot of numbers to sort from, focus on the important data:

#### Revenue:
Amount of money a company brought in during the specified period. It's the first thing you'll see on the income statement, which is often referred to as the **"top line"** Revenue can be broken down into two forms:

1. Operating Revenue: ==gross sales minus returns==
	- revenue generated from its primary business activities:
		- *merchandise sales (Lululemon selling their clothes)*
		- *medical service (Physician gets paid from service they provide)*

2. Non-operating Revenue
	- part of the company's income that is derived from activities not related to its core business operations
		- *dividend income, profits or losses from investments, as well as gains incurred by foreign exchange and asset write-downs.*


#### Net Income:
The **"bottom line"**, listed at the bottom of the income statement.
- Total amount of money a company has made after operating expenses, taxes, and depreciation are subtracted from revenue. 

#### Earnings and Earnings Per Share (EPS):
When you divide earnings by the number of shares available to trade, you get earnings per share. 

- Earnings / Total # of shares = EPS

**This number shows a company's profitability on a per-share basis**, which makes it easier to compare with other companies. (When you see earning per share followed by (ttm) that refers to the "trailing twelve months")

- Not 100% Confident: EPS metrics don't tell you how or how efficiently a company uses its [[capital]].
	- for example, some companies reinvest earnings while others prioritize shareholders in the form of dividends.

#### Price-Earnings Ratio (P/E): stock price / trailing or forward
2 types of P/E formulas: 

1. Dividing a company's current stock price by its earnings per share (EPS) (usually over the last 12 months) gives you a company's **trailing P/E ratio**.

2. Dividing the stock price by forecasted earnings from Wall Street Analysts gives you the **forward P/E**

This measure of a stock's value tells you how much investors ==are wiling to pay to receive $1 of the company's current earnings== 
- how much do they have to own (at demanded price) to 

HIGHER p/e ratios mean investors are expecting higher earnings growth in the future.
- essentially means more "hype"


## 2. Qualitative Analysis (research)
Analysis based off its **intangible qualities** (subjective judgement... *educated guesses*)
- Analysts try to "comprehend" the business rather just its numbers.
	- Meeting with management team
	- Listen how company speaks to shareholders

### Why use Qualitative research over Quantitive?
- Provides insight beyond ratios and metrics
	- Not what how well company is **doing**, how a company **does**
	- Can help boost quantitive research

# What does Qualitative research look like?
- Data comes from numbers instead of words
	- Narrative sections of a company's financial records
		- management discussion and analysis section
	- Newspaper articles
	- Social Media
	- News Outlets
	- Blog posts
