### what does efficiency look like in a market?
![[competitive-market-eff.excalidraw]]

- the location where quantity demanded is also the **efficient quantity**

### Efficiency of Competitive Equilibrium 
- Both producer and seller can make choices out of #self-interest

### Market Failure and Inefficiency

- *market failure*: when either too little (underproduction) or too much (overproduction) of an item is produced

- *deadweight loss*: the decrease in #total-surplus that results from an inefficient level of production

### What can cause market failures?

- **price and quantity regulations**: A *price regulation*, either a price cap or a price floor, blocks the price adjustments that balance the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied and lead to underproduction. A *quantity regulation* that limits the amount that a farm is permitted to produce also leads to underproduction.

- **taxes and subsidies**: taxes increase the prices paid by buyers, lower the prices received by sellers, and lead to underproduction. *Subsidies*, which are payments by government to producers, decrease the prices paid by buyers, increase the prices received by sellers, and lead to overproduction.

- **externalities**: is a cost or benefit that affects someone other than the seller or the buyer. An *external cost* arises when an electric utility burns coal and emits carbon dioxide. The utility doesn't consider the cost of climate change when it decides how much power to produce. The result is overproduction. An *external benefit* arises when an apartment owner installs a smoke detector and decreases her neighbor's fire risk. 

- **public goods and common resources**: a good or service from which everyone benefits and no one can be excluded. National defense is an example. A competitive market would underproduce national defense because everyone would try to free ride on everyone else.

- **monopoly**: is a firm that is the sole provider of a good or service.

- **high transactions costs**
