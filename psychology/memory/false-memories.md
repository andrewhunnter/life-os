> when good memory goes bad

### false memories
- all memories are subject to distortion
- flashbulb memories
	- vivid, emotional, memories recalled with marked detail (*personal context*)
	- rate of forgetting is comparable to that of ordinary memories (Talarico & Rubin, 2007)
		- certain details may still be accurate ("where", Rimmele 2012)
### contributors to false memory formation
- source monitoring errors
	- efforts to identify the origin (source) of a memory
	- important for *distinguishing fantasy vs. reality*
- imagination inflation
	- confusing an imagined event with real life
- therapeutic practices (guided imagery... opens suggestibility)
- even plausibility
- event recency

	- changing blank helped form distortions (Loftus & Palmer 1974)
- Loftus (1978)... **misinformation effect**
	- providing misleading information after an even takes place can lead to formation of false memories
- Memory implantation (Loftus and Pickrell 1995)
	- 25% of participants claimed to remember being los tin the mall as a child

### false memory in the real world
- childhood abuse allegations
	- children particularly vulnerable to false memory (Ceci & Bruck 1993)
	- tendency to engage in imaginative and fantasy play
	- "satanic panic" of the 1980s and 1990s
- eyewitness identifications: witness perpetrator, and situational factors can harm memory accuracy
	- stress (deffenbacher, 2004)
	- cross-race ID (Kassin 2001)
	- Co-wtiness contamination (Goodwin 2012)
	- Short encoding time (Wells, 2006)
- the "memory wars"
	- validity of repressed and recovered memories
