### What is economics?
- Ultimately, the study of choices and their consequences
- Because we can't get everything we want, we must make *choices*

### Concrete definition of economics
> Economics is... the social science that studies the choices individuals, businesses, governments, and entire societies make as they cope with **scarcity** and **incentives** that influence and reconcile those choices

Economics can be broken down into two parts:

1. [[microeconomics]] - is the study of the choices that individuals and businesses make, the way these choices interact in markets, and the influence of governments.

2. [[macroeconomics]] - is the study of the performance of the national economy and the global economy.


The **Two Big** Economic Questions:

1. How do choices end up determining *what*, *how*, and for *whom* goods and services are produced?

	What
	 - what we produce varies across counties and varies over time

	How
	 - factors of productions - Land, Labor, Capital, and Entrepreneurship
	 - Determines income (Rent, Wages, Interest, and Profit)

	Whom
	- who consumes the goods and services that are produced depends on the incomes that people earn. 
		

3. Do choices made in the pursuit of *self-interest* also promote the *social interest*

	self-interest
	- the choices you think are the best one available for you

	social interest
	- choices that are the best one for society as a whole


### The fundamental of economics
- #scarcity - our inability to get everything we want
- #incentive - a reward that encourages an action, or a penalty that discourages one. (an example would be *prices*)
- [[opportunity-cost]] - the highest-valued alternative that we must give up to something
