> when senses meet the brain
### Brain multitasking
- Parallel processing: attending to many sense modalities simultaneously 
	1. **Bottom-up processing** (*what am I seeing*)
		- constructing a whole stimulus from its part
	2. **Top-down processing** (*seen before*)
		- using prior beliefs and expectations to make sense of a stimulus
- desire to "economize" sensory processing

### Perceptual Hypotheses
1. Perceptual sets (top-down processing)
	- expectations influence perceptions
2. Perceptual constancy
	- perceiving stimuli consistently across varied conditions
		- shape, size, and color
3. Gestalt principles
	- how we perceive objects as wholes within overall context

### Gestalt Principles (ties into [[user-experience]])
1. *Proximity*: physical closeness = unified whole
2. *Similarity*: Similar objects = unified whole
3. *Continuity*: Recognize object as whole even if it's partially blocked
4. *Closure*: Brain fills in "missing" information  to perceive unified whole
5. *Symmetry*: Symmetrically arranged = unified whole
6. *Figure-ground*: automatic identification of central vs. peripheral aspects of object (directs attention)
	- if multiple aspects of image can be "central", image is bistable

### Facial Perception
- faces are processed holistically (not *feature* based) (R. Wang, 2012)
- Temporal Lobe - Fusiform Face Area (FFA) (can't put name to face)
- Hippo-campal neurons may fire in response to specific faces (Quiroga 2005)
- Inability to recognize faces, Prosopagnosia (“face blindness”)

### Motion and Depth Perception
- Motion: brain compares visual frames
- Depth - use of cues
	- Monocular cues: one eye
		- relative size, texture, interposition, linear perspective, height in place, light and shadow, motion parallax
	- Binocular cues: both eyes
		- disparity and convergence

### Subliminal and Extrasensory Perception
- Environment processing can be unconscious
	- can we still be influenced by this information
	- not likely (limited processing for meaning) (Rosen, 2003)
- What about extrasensory perception? (ESP)
	- precognition, telepathy, clairvoyance
	- large absence of scientific evidence (replication issues)
	- generation of ad-hoc hypotheses
