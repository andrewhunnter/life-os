### Statistic basics
- purpose is to describe **data**
- central tendency - "where does the data cluster"
- variability - "how loosely or tightly bunched is the data"

### Correlation Coefficients
- Correlation tells us whether two variables are related
- range from -1 < x > 1 (always take absolute value to determine strength)
- opposite ends of spectrum indicate a perfect correlation
- explain relationship amongst data points on a scatterplot

### inferential statistics
- confidence in ability to generalize results to larger population
- look for statistical significance (a = 0.05)
	- likelihood of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is less than 5%
	- finding a false-positive result (saying there is an effect when there isn't)
- account for sample size, effect size, and variability data
- reduce confirmation bias + promote replicability
- important to keep practical significance in mind 
- inferential statistics are **PROBABILITY** based
- watch out for truncated graphs (jumped y axis)
