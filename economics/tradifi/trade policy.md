governs how countries trade goods and services internationally to benefit their economies

### What is the purpose of the trade policy?

1. **Establishes Trade Rules:**
	- Is like a rulebook for how countries buy and sell stuff with each other. It includes things like taxes on imported goods (tariffs), limits on how much can be imported (quotas), and agreements between countries on how they'll trade.

2. **Helping our Economy:**
	- Countries use trade policies to help their own businesses and workers. They might make it cheaper to buy local stuff or limit how much foreign stuff can come into circulation. This is all done to protect jobs and help businesses grow.

3. **Making Friends and Deals:**
	- Trade policy isn't just about money. It's also about making friends and deals with other countries. By agreeing on fair trade rules and making deals, countries can strengthen their relationships and work together better.
