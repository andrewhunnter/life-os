### more about demand
- [[supply]] and [[demand]] are foundational concepts within [[economics]]

### The law of demand

> Other things remaining the same, the higher the price of a good, the smaller is the quantity demanded; and the lower the price of a good, the greater is the quantity demanded. 

- high price = lower demand
- low price = higher demand

### Substitution and Income Effect
- Higher priced goods have the opportunity cost of substitute goods
- Higher prices with unchanged incomes result decrease in demand

### Demand and Quantity Demanded
- demand refers to the *relationship* between **price** and **quantity demanded**
- quantity demanded refers to a point on the demand curve
	- is the amount that consumers plan to buy during a given time period at a particular price (not always the same as the quantity actually bought)
- 

### More ways to understand demand
- is the ability-to-pay curve (which is a measure of #marginal-benefit )

### What influences demand?
- increase = **RIGHT** shift
- decrease = **LEFT** shift

#substitute goods can influence demand
expecting future prices (increase demand at inception)
when income increases, demand also increases
expected income or credit can also increase demand
larger populations have more demand
preferences can also influence demand

### Individual Demand and Market Demand

- *individual demand*: The relationship between the price of a good and the quantity demanded by one person

- *market demand*: the relationship between the price of a good and the wuantity demanded by all buyers

### What is consumer surplus?
- is the excess of the benefit received from a good over the amount paid for it. We can calculate consumer surplus as the #marginal-benefit (or value) of a good minus its price, summed over the quantity bought.
