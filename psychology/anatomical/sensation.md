### sensation vs perception
- 2-step process
	- Sensation - detection pf physical energy by sense organs (eyes, ears, skin, nose, tongue)
	- perception - brain's interpretation of sensory input

### our sense as detectives: TRANSDUCTION
- external stimulus is converted into electric signals via transduction (specialized sensory receptors for each type of sensory stimulus) 

### sensation - detecting stimuli
- absolute thresholds demonstrate sensitivity of our sensory systems
	- lowest level of stimulus detected on 50% of trials
- Just noticeable difference (JND)
	- smallest detectable change in stimulus intensity
	- adheres to weber's law (original stimulus intensity dictates JND)

- Signal Detection Theory (Green and Swets)
	- accuracy at detecting signal; under uncertain conditions
	- manipulation of noise and signal presence
		- signal-to-noise ratio
- response bias
- compare frequency of false negatives (misses) to false positives (false alarms)

### Sensation: cross-modal processing
- experienced sensation can be combination of processing modalities
	- "cross-talk" between brain groups
	- language processing: McGurk Effect (McGurk & McDonald)
	- combination of sensations: synesthesia
		- "colored hearing"

### role of attention in sensation
- selective nature is critical
- tuning into one "channel" at a time
- filter theory of attention (Broadbent, 1957)
	- We can intentionally attend vs. ignore due to slower flow
	- Dichotic listening task (Broadbent; 1957; Treisman, 1960)
- Cocktail party effect


### Inattentional vs. Change Blindness

- Inattentional Blindless: failure to detect visual stimulus altogether

- Change Blindness: failure to detect change in stimulus already detected (issue of working memory)
