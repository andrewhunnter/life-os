the process of **listening** and **observing** your community and environment

### pillars of rhetorical awareness
1. **Observe**: All visual stimulus that can influence how you view the subject
	- external sources like clothes, language, and tone can be rhetorical

3. **Consider**: look into the world with more intention and meaning
	- for example, "arguments" are not bad but a disparity in solutions

5. **Listening**: Holding "space" for others to *express themselves*
	- introduces us to new problems (within the community)
	- helps us view old problems in new ways
	- asks us to be open to others perspectives
