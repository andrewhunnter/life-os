### total revenue and economics
- heavily influences [[elasticity]]

### how does revenue influence elasticity
- If demand is elastic, a 1 percent cut increases the quantity sold by more than 1 percent and total revenue **increases**.

- If demand is inelastic, a 1 percent price cut increases the quantity sold by less than 1 percent and total revenue **decreases**. 

- If demand is unit elastic, a 1 percent price cut increases the quantity sold by 1 percent and total revenue **does not change**.

> peak revenue is at "**unit elasticity**"

### The Total Revenue Test

- If a price cut increases total revenue, demand is elastic.

- If a price cut decreases total revenue, demand is inelastic.

- If a price cut leaves total revenue unchanged, demand is unit elastic.
