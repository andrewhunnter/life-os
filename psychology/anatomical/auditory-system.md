### Sound: Mechanical Vibration
- vibration(s) traveling through substance (air)
	- particle disturbance - sound waves
- Characteristics of sound waves
	1. Pitch: Wave frequency (How close together)
	2. Loudness: wave amplitude (how tall)
	3. Timbre: wave complexity

### Structure and function of the ear
- sound waves traduced into neural activity

1. outer ear
	- pinna: visual structure of ear
	- ear canal: funnels sound waves to the middle ear (the eardrum)

2. middle ear
	- eardrum: bounces sound waves to inner ear
	- ossicles: tinniest bones in human body
		- hammer
		- anvil
		- stirrup

3. Inner ear
	- cochlea: converts sound waves
		- organ of corti (transduction)
		- basilar membrane
	- auditory nerve: carries action potentials to thalamus

### Models of Pitch Perception
- high-pitch tones (5,000-20,000 Hz)

1. Place Theory
	- Tone/pitch are matched at specific point on basilar membrane (processed at different place in auditory cortex)

- low-pitch tones (20-5,000 Hz)
	1. Frequency theory - action potential firing reproduces pitch (up to 100 Hz)
	2. Volley Theory - sets of neurons fire out of sync to reach cumulative speed (100-5,000 Hz)

### When we can't hear
- conductive deafness
	- malfunctioning of ear structures (eardrum and ossicles)
- nerve deafness (damage to the auditory nerve)
- noise-induced hearing loss
	- damage to hair cells (organ of corti or basilar membrane)
	- interferes with transduction
