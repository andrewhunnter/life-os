### what are lambdas?
- [[python]] lambda functions are anonymous function that don't have a name
- as we already know, "def" is a keyword used to define a normal  function in python
- other languages often use them

### purpose of lambdas?
- you only need the function once (throwaway)
- used for tiny functions (condense data set from a calculation)
- passing a function as an argument
