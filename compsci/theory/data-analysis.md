### data analysis techniques
1. **descriptive statistics** - mean, median, standard deviation, distribution (used to summarize client performance or departmental KPIs)

2. **trend & time series analysis**
	- compare financial performance over time
	- spot seasonality or anomalies 

3. **pivot tables + conditional logic**
	- compare departments, clients, time periods
	- create "if-then" scenarios or cost buckets 

4. **outlier detection**
	- using z-score or basic range to flag odd transactions or errors 
	- z-score helps you tell how far a data point is from the mean... measured in standard deviation
	- if data is tight around the average... it's predictable and stable
	- if the data is scattered, it means more risk, inconsistency, or unusual behavior 

5. **forecasting / projections**
	- you might use basic linear regression or moving averages to project forward
