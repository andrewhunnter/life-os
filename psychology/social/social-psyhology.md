### What is social psch?
- study of how people influence others' behavior, beliefs, and attitudes (Lewin, 1951)
	- For better or worse

### Why do we form groups?
- Need-to-belong theory (Leary, 1995)
	- Need for interpersonal connection is biologically-based
- Schachter (1959) pilot study on isolation (n = 5)
	- Parallels solitary confinement practices in prison (Grassian, 2006)
- Twenge (2002)... We react to mere threat of social isolation

- loneliness
	- not only about being physically alone
	- social or emotional isolation + distress about those feelings
	- long-term loneliness can affect our health (Caioppo & Caioppo 2018, McQuaid 2021)

### Why do people affect us?
- Social influence is powerful (Cislaghi & Heise, 2019)
	- Often unconscious
- Most forms of social influence are adaptive (Tybur & Griskevicius, 2013)
	- Naturally selected over evolutionary course
- Social comparison theory... Where do we stand relative to our peers? (Festinger, 1954)
- Comparison may be upward or downward
	- Both can bolster self-concepts
		- "Exception to the rule" as a buffer against feelings of inferiority (Alicke, 1997)
- Social contagion: look to others for cues to action in ambigious circumstances
- Mass hysteria
	- outbreak of irrational behavior fueled by anxiety
	- can lead to collective delusions, conspiracy theories, and "fake news"
- Urban Legends:
	- false stories repeated over time; eventually believed to be true
	- Surprising but plausible (Gilovich, 1991)
	- Tug on negative emotions (Eriksson & Coultas, 2014)

### Social Facilitation and Disruption...
- Presence of others can facilitate performance on tasks we find easy (Triplett, 1897)
- Difficult tasks may lead to social disruption ("choking")
	- Limits working memory

### Fundamental Attribution Error (FAE)...
- Attribution assigning cause(s) to behavior 
	- Dispositional vs. situational
- When evaluating others: dispositional influences *>*(who they are)  situational influences (factors at play)
	- rarely aware of situational factors at play
- When evaluating self... dispositional influences *<* situational influences
- Less potent in collectivist cultures
