### what influences the housing market...
- A government regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price higher than a specified level is called a [[price-ceiling]] or price cap
	- a price ceiling above the [[market-equilibrium]] price has *no effect*
	- a price ceiling below the [[market-equilibrium]] price has *POWERFUL* effects on a market
		a. causes housing shortages
		b. increased #search-activity
		c. creates an illicit market


### housing shortage
- happen because rent is sent below the equilibrium rent, which causes the demand to exceed the quantity of housing supplied... causing a **shortage**
	- This results in allocation... **increasing #search-activity** 
	- #search-activity is costly... using time and other resources

> SEARCH ACTIVITY: the time spent looking for someone with whome to do business

- A price ceiling on rent set below the equilibrium rent results in an inefficient underproduction of housing services. 
	- The *marginal social benefit* of housing exceeds its *marginal social cost*

### housing and [[opportunity-cost]]
- the opportunity cost of a good is equal not only to its *price* but also to the *value of the search time* spend finding the good. 

### illicit markets
- a price ceiling on rent also encourages illegal trading in an illicit market, in which the equilibrium  price exceeds the price ceiling. 
- For example, if there is a price ceiling... renters might find ways to take cash via other services within the apartment (like having renters buy new locks + keys)
	- The goal is for renters to reach equilibrium so they can their business is sustainable, exceeding equilibrium with an illicit market can drive profit and growth 

### regulation effect on housing
- a price ceiling on rent increases #search-activity which might end up making the full cost of housing higher than it would be without a rent ceiling
