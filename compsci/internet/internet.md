### Why is the internet important?
- It is the foundation upon which most modern software applications are built. In order to build *effective*, *secure*, and *scalable* applications and services, you need to have a solid understanding of how the internet works an dhow to leverage its power an connectivity. 

### How does the internet work?
- At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and computer systems together using a set of #standardized-protocols. These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely.

Visual of the internet... All devices connect to routers which are connected to each other (the internet) and send data back and fourth via #packets.

In order to make sure #packets are sent and received correctly, the internet uses a variety of [[protocols]], including the Internet Protocol (IP) and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). These are the foundational protocols of the internet.

1. **Internet Protocol (IP)**: is responsible for routing packets to their correct destination.

2. **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**: ensures that packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order.
