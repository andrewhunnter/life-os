### What is pseudoscience?
- lacks safeguards to protect against confirmation bias and belief perseverance (the main [[psychology]] biases)

### Key Indicators of Pseudoscience
- exaggerated claims
- over-reliance on anecdotes
- claims of "proof"
- lack of peer review

### Evaluating psychological claims
- emotional reasoning fallacy (not true because it makes you uncomfortable)
- bandwagon fallacy
- "not me" fallacy
### Why does it matter?
- Helps differentiate claims and findings within the [[psychology]] science between fact or fake information 
### Why are we prey to pseudoscience?
- **patternicity**: tendency to identify patterns in meaningless data (order from chaos)
- **terror management theory**: adopting worldviews that reinforce broader meaning/purpose to life allows us to cope with finite existence (*religion*)

### Why should we care?
- helps their average person identify their [[opportunity-cost]]'s when going about their mental health. (seeking different treatments)

- pseudoscience encourages the general population to think more critically, preventing them from the dangers of pseudoscience
