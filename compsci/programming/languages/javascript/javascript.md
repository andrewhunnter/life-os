> a programming language that adds interactivity to your website

### what is javascript
- Is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the [[internet]]... alongside html and css. It allow us to add interactivity to pages via sliders, alerts, click interactions, popups, and etc on different websites.

- It also used in non-browser environments such as node.js for writing server-side code in javascript.

### foundational javascript concepts

- ***var** - function scoped

- ***let** - block scoped

- ***const*** - block scoped & no reassignment

- ***closure*** - is when an inner function remembers and accesses variables from its outer function, even after the outer function has returned

- ***event loop*** - lets javascript handle non-blocking operations using a queue (async understanding)

### why javascript?
- browser built [[api]](s) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating html and setting css styles.

- third-party [[api]](s) that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers

- third-party [[framework]](s) and [[libraries]] that you can apply to html to accelerate building a user interface, enhancing [[user-experience]].
