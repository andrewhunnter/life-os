### what is the purpose of pandas? 
- it simplifies tasks like cleaning, filtering, and analyzing data. It lets you quickly load, inspect, and transform data iwth a high-level interface

### "use case" of pandas...
- imagine having a large table (like a CSV file in excel) and being able to effortlessly sort, filter, and transform its contents.
- pandas turns that process into simple code commands, much like using a powerful search and replace tool on steriods

### overarching goal of pandas...
- data handling and transformation are common tasks in #software-engineering. Whether you are processing logs, or preparing data for [[machine-learning]]... pandas teaches you the importance of clear maintainable code when dealing with data
