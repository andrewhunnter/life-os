### Theories of Emotion (think *limbic system*)
1. Discrete Emotions Theory
	- Small number of distinct emotions that combine in complex ways (Tomkins, 1962)
		- Distinct biological roots
		- Distinct evolutionary function(s)
	- Emotional reaction comes *before* thoughts
	- Emotions are innate and essentially universal (Freedman, 1964)

### Emotions as Evolved Expressions
- Evidence for evolutionary basis of emotion:
	1. Emotional Expressions that don't require direct reinforcement
		- Infant smiling when alone (Plutchik, 2003)
		- Expressions in infants born blind (Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1973)
	2. Behavioral Immune System
		- "Disgusting" stimuli often contain harmful bacteria (Tybur, 2013)
		- Physiological chnages (anger, fear)
	3. Similarities between humans and non-humans (Darwin, 1872)
	4. Cultural Universality
		- Ekman and Friesen (1971): Expression recognition in New Guinea
		- Primary Emotions (Ekman, 1999)

### A note on Culture and Emotion
- People don't always agree on facial expression-emotion match (Jack et al, 2012)
	- But levels of agreement are still higher than chance
	- Possible differences in display rules (Ekman & Friesen, 1975)
		- Culture can change how emotions are expressed
	- Friesen (1972): Japanese vs. American students' reactions to gory film

### Think First, Feel Later... [[cognition]] and emotion
- Emotions are product of thinking
	- Interpretation of situation influences response (Scherer, 1988)
- Emotions are not easily categorized (no "discrete" or "innate" emotions)
	- Emotions are as diverse as our thoughts (Barrett, 2017)

1. James-Lange Theory: emotions result from interpretations of bodily reactions to stimuli (James 1890, Lange 1885)
	- Observations of physiological state determine emotion
2. Somatic Marker Theory: unconscious use of autonomic responses to determine course action (Damasio, 1994)
	- Physiological "markers" help us make decisions
3. Cannon-Bard Theory: emotional and bodily reactions to stimulus happen simultaneously
	- Thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, (Inman, 2020)
4. Two-factor theory: an emotion is produced by two psychological events
	- Undifferentiated physiological arousal (alertness)
	- Attribution of arousal ("labelling")
	- Emotions are the explanations we attach to state of arousal
- Schachter and Singer (1962): Adrenaline injection and emotion

### Unconscious Influences on Emotion
- Mere exposure effect
	- Familiarity (through repeated exposure) enhances favorability (Zajonc, 1968)
	- subliminal exposure
- Facial Feedback hypothesis
	- Feedback from facial blood vessels to the brain alters experience of emotions (Zajonc, 1989)
