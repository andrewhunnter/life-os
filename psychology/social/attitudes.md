### Attitudes and Persuasion
- Belief vs. Attitude
	- Belief: conclusion regarding factual evidence
	- Attitude: belief + emotion
- Attitudes are only moderate predictors of behavior (r = 0.38)
- When they do predict
	- highly accessible (Fazio, 1995)
	- firmly held and stable over time (conner, 2000)
	- in people who are low in self-monitoring (Kraus, 1995)

### Cognitive Dissonance Theory
- Attitudes may be less consistent over time than we'd like to think
- need to reduce or eliminate feelings of tension caused by 2+ conflicting cognitions
	- Change cognition A
	- Change cognition B
	- Introduce cognition C

### Persuasion
- Two pathways to persuading others (dual-access models of persuasion)... (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986)

1. **Central route**
	- careful and thoughtful consideration of argument's merits
	- Focuses on informational content
		- procedures strongly held, enduring attitudes
	- Overall, better form of persuasion

2. **Peripheral route**
	- reliance on snap judgments
	- focuses on surface elements of argument
		- weaker and unstable, but can still affect short-term choices

### Persuasion Techniques
- Foot-in-the-door: small request... large request
- Door-in-the-face: large request... small request
- Low-balling: agree to price... add-ons until cost is much higher than original agreement
- "But you are free": giving people sense that they are free to choose
	- doubles odds of compliance to request
