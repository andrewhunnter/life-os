### Touch, body, position, and balance
> our body sense

- touch, pressure, and temperature
- can be specific, generalized, or referred
- Specialized + free nerve endings in the skin
	- most numerous on fingertips
	- fewest on middle back

### touch and pain
1. Sensory info travels through somatic nerves to spinal cord
	- touch travels faster than pain
	- activation of local reflexes
2. Upward travel through brain stem and thalamus to somatosensory cortex
	- ties to limbic-system
	- anxiety, uncertainty, helplessness

### Types of Pain
- Sharp, stabbing, throbbing, burning, or aching
- May or may not have direct physical cause
- "Acute" (short-lived) or "chronic" (enduring)
- Pain threshold must be met
	- Gate control (Melzack & Wall, 1965)
		- Pain blocked from consciousness under some (very particular) circumstances
		- Pain reduction via diverted attention (Hoffman & Patterson, 2005)

### When we can't feel pain
- Deficit in transmission of pain signals to brain
- Pain insensitivity from birth is extremely rare but can be inherited (Schon 2020)
- DANGEROUS!

### Body, position, and Balance
- Propioception ("kinesthetic" sense)
	- Sense of body position
		- Stretch receptors in muscles
		- Force Detectors in tendons 
- Vestibular sense (equilibrium)
	- Sense of balance
	- semicircular canals in inner ear
