> Thinking, reasoning, and problem solving...


### Cognitive Economy
- Goal: streamline daily cognitive tasks
	- we are "cognitive misers"
- Simplify what we attend to
	- keep information required for a decision at a minimum
		- "fast and frugal"
- Usually helpful, but can lead to oversimplification and faulty conclusions (Lehrer, 2009)

### Heuristics and Biases
- Heuristics: mental "*shortcuts*"

1. **REPRESENTATIVE HEURISTICS**
	- Judging probability of event based on its resemblance to a prototype or past event (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974)
	- Affected by base rates
		- commonness of a behavior or characteristic in the general population 

2. **AVAILBILITY HEURISTIC**
	- judging probability of event based on how easily it comes to mind (Kahneman et al., 1982 )
	- easier we can think of if... easier it can be affected (shark week and shark attacks)

3. **HINDSIGHT BIAS**
	- "knew it all along" effect of "Monday morning quarterbacking"
		- everything seem obvious once we know the outcome
	- overestimating predictability after-the-fact

### Top-Down Processing (also from [[perception]])
- Involves filling in informational gaps with preexisting knowledge/experience

- reliance on concepts and schemas (from memory [[processes]])
	- **concepts**: *group together* objects, actions, events, and ideas that share core properties (based on prototype)
	- **schemas**: mental framework *representing relationship* between concepts, objects, actions , ideas
		- organize events (scripts)
		- help us interpret information
		- allow us to generate expectations

### Top-Down Processing: Language
- two theories

1. **LINGUISTIC DETERMINISM**: language defines thinking (aka no language means no thoughts)

2. **LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY**: language shapes thought processes (Sapir-Whorf hypothesis)
	- more scientific support than LD
