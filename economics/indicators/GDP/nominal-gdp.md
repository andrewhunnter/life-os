### what is nominal [[gross-domestic-product]]
- measures the economic output using current prices in the year the goods and services are produced
- it doesn't adjust for inflation... meaning if prices increase over time, nominal GDP might rise even if the actual volume of goods and services produced remains unchanged

### calculating growth rates...
- current year - previous year / previous year = growth rate for the year
