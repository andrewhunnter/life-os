1. **DURATION**: 
	- One-time behaviors: single use events like signing up

	- Short-term behaviors: actions that place place for a limited period of time like using the trail version of a product

	- Long-term behaviors: ongoing behaviors that happen or happen repeatedly over a considerable time

2. **FREQUENCY**:
	- Single-instance behaviors: behaviors that occur only one time per occasion (entering a password)

	- Infrequent behaviors: do not happen regularly, or happen once in a while like posting on social media

	- Frequent behaviors: happen on a consistent and regular basis like checking emails or sharing posts

3. **INTENSITY**:
	- Low-stakes behavior: have little impact or are considered less important like choosing a profile picture or bio

	- Medium-stakes behavior: Have moderate importance or impact like providing personal information when singing up

	- High-stakes behaviors: have significant impact on the user's experience like making a purchase or cancelling a subscription
