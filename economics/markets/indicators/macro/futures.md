### what are futures?
- futures are agreements to buy or sell something at a predetermined price on a specific date in the future
- when it comes to the S&P500, you're not trading the actual stocks in the #index, but rather a #contract that represents the index's future value

### some examples of popular futures that gauge market...
1. **S&P 500 Futures**: tracks the 500 largest U.S. companies
	- the index number is like a "price tag" for the combined value of 500 large companies, it's just an indicator of overall market value

 2. **VIX** (Volatility Index): known as the "fear gauge" because it measures expected market volatility
	- a high VIX indicates that investors expect a lot of market swings
	- a low VIX indicates calm, less dramatic market swings
	- expressed as a percent... represents the market's expected volatility in percentage terms over the next 30 days

### role of futures in the [[stock-market]]
- **liquidity & trading flexibility:** futures markets operate around the clock (24/7), offering continuous insight into market expectations. This liquidity means that large investors can quickly enter positions

- **price discovery & early signals**: since trading futures starts before the regular market opens, they provide valuable clues about what might happen once the market is live

- risk management & hedging: investors use futures to protect (hedge) their investments against adverse price movements. For example, if an investor fears a market downturn, they *might **short** S&P futures* to balance potential losses in their stock portfolio

- speculation & investment strategy: beyond hedging, traders speculate on the future direction of the market using futures.
