> when a [[price-floor]] is applied to a labor market, it is called a ==minimum wage==
### a labor market with a minimum wage
- firms decide *how much labor to demand*
- households decide *how much labor to supply*

### what influences minimum wage?
- a government regulation that makes it illegal to charge a price lower than a specified level is called a **price floor**
	- the effects of a price floor on a market depend crucially on whether the floor is imposed at a level that is above or below the [[market-equilibrium]] price.

1. a **price floor** set below the [[market-equilibrium]] price has *no effect*
2. a **price floor** set above the [[market-equilibrium]] price has *POWERFUL* effects on a market


### how does minimum wage influence a market?
- a minimum wage imposed above the equilibrium wage creates **unemployment**
