### Light: The Energy of Life
- Fluctuating electric + magnetic waves
- Each species detects specific wavelength (namometers)
- light is partly reflected and partly absorbed
- intensity of reflection - brightness
- color of light is its hue (humans: red, green, blue)

### The Eye
- Pupil: Point of light entrance
- Iris: controls entrance of light via dilation/constriction
- Cornea: Focuses visual image on retina
- Lens: changes shape to achieve accommodation (focuses image)
- Retina: Rods and cones (low vs. high light conditions)
- optic nerve
	- retinal ganglion cell axons
	- point of connection to retina is our blind spot
- optic chiasm
	- point of optic nerve axon crossover
- connections to thalamus V1

### Eye shapes and vision 
- nearsightedness (aka myopia)
	- eye is too long, or cornea is too steep
	- image focus falls short of retina
- farsightedness (aka hyperopia)
	- eye it too short, or cornea is too flat
	- image focus overshoots retina

### Perceiving Shape and Contour
- Objects identified via certain minimal patterns
	- Feature detector cells in V1 (early visual processing)
		- lines and edges
- Feature detector cells in V2 (late visual processing)
	- portions of parietal, temporal lobes
	- lines of specific length, complex shapes, and moving objects

### Perceiving Color
- 2 theories of color perception:
	1. Trichromatic theory (aka the "young helmholtz theory")
		- 3 types of cones detect 3 primary colors (R,B,G)
		- color vision evolved because perceiving color gave our ancestors an advantage when foraging food

	2. Opponent process theory
		- color perceived in terms of 3 pairs of opponent cells
			- red vs. green
			- blue vs. yellow
			- black vs. white
		- in the end... both theories are "correct"

### When we can't see or perceive visually
- Blindess
	- complete lack of visual ability or score of 20/200 on Snellen eye chart
- Blindsight
	- functional eyes but damage to V1 (primary visual cortex)
	- can't make correct guesses about appearnace of envrionemnt
- Visual agnosia
	- issues of object perception
	- lack of recognition
